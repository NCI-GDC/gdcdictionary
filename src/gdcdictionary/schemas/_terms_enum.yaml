      epithelium are called transitional cell carcinomas. Morphologically, the malignant
      epithelial cells may display abnormal mitotic figures, anaplasia, and necrosis.
      Carcinomas are graded by the degree of cellular differentiation as well, moderately,
      or poorly differentiated. Carcinomas invade the surrounding tissues and tend
      to metastasize to other anatomic sites. Lung carcinoma, skin carcinoma, breast

      are equally affected. UV damage and ingestion of inorganic arsenic may play
      a role in the development of the disease. On the skin surface, it presents as
      a single or multiple erythematous, scaly, keratotic patches or plaques. The
      clinical entity of erythroplasia of Queyrat is regarded as Bowen disease of
      the penis and it presents as an asymptomatic, red, circumscribed plaque. Morphologically,
      Bowen disease is characterized by the presence of hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis,
      dyskeratosis, and acanthosis. The keratotic squamous cells are atypical and
      display hyperchromatism and abnormal mitotic figures. The dermoepidermal basement
      membrane is intact. Complete surgical removal of the lesion may be curative.

      The most frequently seen skin cancer. It arises from basal cells of the epidermis

      nodular, ulcerative, superficial, multicentric, erythematous, and sclerosing
      or morphea-like. More than 95% of these carcinomas occur in patients over 40.
      They develop on hair-bearing skin, most commonly on sun-exposed areas. Approximately
      85% are found on the head and neck and the remaining 15% on the trunk and extremities.
      Basal cell carcinoma usually grows in a slow and indolent fashion. However,
      if untreated, the tumor may invade the subcutaneous fat, skeletal muscle and
      bone. Distant metastases are rare. Excision, curettage and irradiation cure
      most basal cell carcinomas.

      A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is

      south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over
      the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and
      even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females
      and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.
      Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present
      as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically,
      there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated
      to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize
      to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver
      cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular
      carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of
      tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

      The adenomas are most often tubular, and they have the tendency to progress
      to adenocarcinoma. They can occur throughout the colon, but they tend to concentrate
      in the rectum and sigmoid colon. The colorectal adenomas are detected during
      endoscopic examination between the age of 10 and 20 years. The adenomas increase
      in size and numbers with age, and there is usually progression of one or more
      adenomas to adenocarcinoma. The mean age of development of adenocarcinoma is
      about 40 years. Signs include rectal bleeding and mucousy diarrhea.

      tumor suppressor gene MEN-1, type 2A (MEN 2A), caused by mutation of the RET
      gene, type 2B (MEN 2B) also caused by mutation of the RET gene, and type 4 (MEN

      and parathyroid gland adenomas, pituitary gland adenomas, pancreatic islet cell
      neoplasms, and carcinoid tumors. Patients with MEN 2A develop medullary thyroid
      carcinomas and may also develop pheochromocytomas and parathyroid gland hyperplasia.
      Patients with MEN 2B develop medullary thyroid carcinomas and numerous neural

      A phosphoramidate derivative of the monophosphate form of cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine;
      3'-dA), an adenosine derivative first isolated from Cordyceps sinensis, with
      potential antineoplastic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Upon
      administration and cellular uptake of NUC-7738 by passive diffusion, cordycepin
      monophosphate (3'-dAMP) is converted into its active anti-cancer metabolite
      3'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (3'-dATP). 3'-dATP functions as a ribonucleoside
      analogue and competes with ATP during transcription. Therefore, this agent causes
      RNA synthesis inhibition, inhibits cellular proliferation, and induces apoptosis.
      Also, 3'-dAMP activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and reduces mammalian
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. This prevents the hyperphosphorylation
      of the translation repressor protein 4E-BP1. This results in the induction of
      tumor cell apoptosis and a decrease in tumor cell proliferation. mTOR, a serine/threonine
      kinase belonging to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase
      (PIKK) family, plays an important role in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
      that regulates cell growth and proliferation, and its expression or activity
      is frequently dysregulated in human cancers. Compared to cordycepin alone, the
      addition of the phosphoramidate moiety may overcome cancer resistance and allow
      for greater cytotoxicity as NUC-7738 does not require a nucleoside transporter
      for cellular uptake, is independent of  enzymatic activation by adenosine kinase
      (AK) and is not susceptible to enzymatic degradation by adenosine deaminase
      (ADA). Altogether, this may help overcome cancer resistance to cordycepin.

      An orally bioavailable immune checkpoint inhibitor and antagonist of the adenosine
      A2A receptor (A2AR; ADORA2A), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon administration, A2AR antagonist EOS100850 selectively binds
      to and inhibits A2AR expressed on T-lymphocytes. This prevents tumor-released
      adenosine from interacting with the A2A receptors, thereby blocking the adenosine/A2AR-mediated
      inhibition of T-lymphocytes. This results in the proliferation and activation
      of T-lymphocytes, and stimulates a T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor
      cells. A2AR, a G protein-coupled receptor, is highly expressed on the cell surfaces
      of T-cells and, upon activation by adenosine, inhibits their proliferation and
      activation. Adenosine is often overproduced by cancer cells and plays a key
      role in immunosuppression.

      The adenomas are most often tubular, and they have the tendency to progress
      to adenocarcinoma. They can occur throughout the colon, but they tend to concentrate
      in the rectum and sigmoid colon. The colorectal adenomas are detected during
      endoscopic examination between the age of 10 and 20 years. The adenomas increase
      in size and numbers with age, and there is usually progression of one or more
      adenomas to adenocarcinoma. The mean age of development of adenocarcinoma is
      about 40 years. Signs include rectal bleeding and mucousy diarrhea.

      An orally bioavailable immune checkpoint inhibitor and antagonist of the adenosine
      A2A receptor (A2AR; ADORA2A), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon administration, A2AR antagonist CS3005 selectively binds to
      and inhibits A2AR expressed on T-lymphocytes. This prevents tumor-released adenosine
      from interacting with the A2A receptors, thereby blocking the adenosine/A2AR-mediated
      inhibition of T-lymphocytes. This results in the proliferation and activation
      of T-lymphocytes, and stimulates a T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor
      cells. A2AR, a G protein-coupled receptor, is highly expressed on the cell surfaces
      of T-cells and, upon activation by adenosine, inhibits their proliferation and
      activation. Adenosine is often overproduced by cancer cells and plays a key
      role in immunosuppression.

    description: >-
      A recombinant adenoviral serotype 5 (Ad5) in which the Ad5-based vector fiber

      for the human guanylyl cyclase C (hGCC), and fused to the synthetic Pan DR epitope
      (PADRE), with potential antineoplastic and immunomodulating activities. Upon
      intramuscular administration of the Ad5/F35-hGCC-PADRE, the Ad5/F35 targets
      CD46, which is expressed widely on most tumor cells, and the virus is taken
      up by cells. Once inside the cells, the virus expresses hGCC. The expressed
      hGCC induces both humoral and cellular immune responses against tumor cells
      expressing the hGCC antigen. This results in the immune-mediated killing of
      tumor cells. The hGCC protein is normally restricted to intestinal epithelial
      cells but is overexpressed by metastatic colorectal tumors. PADRE is a helper
      T-lymphocyte epitope that is able to augment the magnitude and duration of the
      cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. The inclusion of the chimeric Ad5/F35
      fiber increases viral uptake in cells through CD46.

      activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-engineered, gene-edited T-lymphocytes
      that have been transduced with a vector expressing a chimeric antigen receptor
      (CAR) containing a single chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a monoclonal
      antibody specific for the human tumor-associated antigen (TAA) B-cell maturation
      antigen (BCMA; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 17; TNFRSF17),
      with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Using TALEN
      technology, the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha chain (TRAC) and CD52 genes are
      deleted from the CAR T-cells. Upon administration, the allogeneic anti-BCMA
      CAR-transduced T-cells ALLO-715 specifically recognize and induce selective
      toxicity in BCMA-expressing tumor cells. BCMA, a receptor for both a proliferation-inducing
      ligand (APRIL) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF), is a member of the tumor
      necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF). BCMA is found on the surfaces
      of plasma cells, is overexpressed on malignant plasma cells and plays a key
      role in plasma cell proliferation and survival. Deletion of the CD52 gene makes
      the modified donor T-cells resistant to an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody treatment,
      that is used during lymphodepletion. The knockout of TRAC eliminates TCR expression
      and is intended to abrogate the potential induction of graft-versus-host disease
      (GvHD) by the donor T-cells. The donor-derived, gene-edited CAR T cells have
      reduced production times and have increased availability when compared to autologous
      CAR-T cells, which use the patient's own cells and are produced on an individual
      basis. In addition, if the ALLO-715 cells cause unacceptable side effects, the
      incorporated CD20-based off-switch permits selective depletion of the ALLO-715
      cells when the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab is administered.

      tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs) and intracellular adaptor proteins. SLAMF7
      is highly expressed on certain malignant plasma cells and is minimally expressed

    description: >-
      A human bispecific antibody targeting both epidermal growth factor receptor
      EGFR and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR; cMet), with potential antineoplastic

      to wild-type or certain mutant forms of both EGFR and cMet expressed on cancer
      cells, thereby preventing receptor phosphorylation. This prevents the activation
      of both EGFR- and cMet-mediated signaling pathways. In addition, binding results
      in receptor degradation, which further inhibits EGFR- and cMet-mediated signaling.
      JNJ-61186372 also causes antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Altogether,
      this results in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. EGFR and cMet, both
      upregulated or mutated in a variety of tumor cell types, play key roles in tumor
      cell proliferation.

      The anhydrous form of enol-oxaloacetate, a small molecule blood glutamate scavenger,
      that can be used to lower glutamate plasma levels, and has potential neuroprotective
      activity. Upon administration, enol-oxaloacetate targets and binds to glutamate
      in the bloodstream. This lowers glutamate plasma levels and lowers the free
      glutamate available to be picked up by cells, such as tumor brain cells, thereby
      preventing glutamate metabolism and glutamate-mediated signaling. This prevents
      the proliferation of rapidly growing cells, such as brain tumor cells. And by
      lowering glutamate plasma levels, a molecular imbalance is formed and glutamate
      is excreted across the blood-brain barrier, resulting in lower free brain glutamate.  This
      may help protect the brain from excitotoxicity in conditions where there is
      a surge of glutamate production, such as traumatic brain injury, thereby protecting
      neuronal cells. Glutamate, a non-essential amino acid and the major excitatory
      neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), provides energy and generates
      building blocks for the production of macromolecules, which are needed for cellular

      A bispecific monoclonal antibody composed of two single-chain variable fragments
      (scFv), one directed against the B-cell-specific membrane protein CD19, and
      another that is directed against the human cell surface antigen CD47, with potential
      immunostimulating, phagocytosis-inducing and antineoplastic activities. Upon
      administration of anti-CD47/CD19 bispecific monoclonal antibody TG-1801, the
      anti-CD19 moiety selectively targets and binds to CD19 on CD19-positive B-cells,
      thereby improving binding of the anti-CD47 moiety to the CD19+ malignant B-cells.
      The CD47 binding by TG-1801 blocks the interaction of CD47 with signal regulatory
      protein alpha (SIRPalpha), an inhibitory protein expressed on macrophages and
      dendritic cells (DCs), which prevents CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated signaling and
      abrogates the CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis. This induces
      pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which
      is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), expressed on macrophages, which results
      in macrophage activation and the specific phagocytosis of the CD19/CD47-expressing
      tumor cells. Additionally, blocking CD47 signaling activates an anti-tumor T-lymphocyte
      immune response and T-cell-mediated killing of CD19/CD47-expressing tumor cells.
      In addition, TG-1801 induces an anti-tumor activity through the induction of
      antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). CD47, also called integrin-associated
      protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), widely expressed on normal,
      healthy cells, such as red blood cells and platelets, and overexpressed on the
      surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction
      with SIRPalpha, leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects
      cancer cells from phagocytosis, which allows cancer cells to proliferate. CD19
      is a membrane antigen that is widely expressed during B-cell development and
      in B-cell malignancies. By co-targeting CD47 and CD19, TG-1801 has the potential
      to overcome the limitations of existing CD47-targeted therapies by possibly
      avoiding the side effects caused by binding to CD47 on healthy hematopoietic
      stem cells (HSCs) which causes unwanted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis.

      cells. As ONC-392 is dissociated from CTLA-4 under low pH, it does not cause
      lysosomal degradation of CTLA-4, preserving CTLA-4 and allowing the recycling
      of CTLA-4. This may result in more efficient and selective CTLA-4-targeted regulatory
      T-cell (Treg) depletion within the tumor microenvironment (TME) while preserving

      A probody composed of a modified version of ipilimumab, a recombinant human
      monoclonal antibody directed against the human T-cell receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
      antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4), linked to a proprietary masking peptide that covers
      the active antigen-binding site of the antibody through a protease-cleavable
      linker, with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities.
      Upon administration of anti-CTLA-4 probody BMS-986288, the masking peptide is
      cleaved by tumor-associated proteases upon extravasation into the tumor microenvironment
      (TME). Protease-mediated removal of the linker enables binding of the unmasked
      monoclonal antibody moiety to CTLA-4, which is expressed on certain T-cells.
      This inhibits the CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation, and leads
      to both activation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells and a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
      (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells. CTLA4, an inhibitory receptor
      and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on activated effector
      T-cells (Teffs) and regulatory T-cells (Tregs), plays a key role in the inhibition
      of T-cell activity and downregulation of the immune system. The peptide masking
      of BMS-986288 minimizes binding to CTLA-4 in normal tissues and may reduce systemic
      toxicity, when compared to ipilimumab. Tumor-associated proteases are present
      in high concentrations and aberrantly activated in the TME.

      checkpoint receptors programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and
      the human cell surface antigen CD47, with potential immunostimulating, phagocytosis-inducing
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of anti-PD-1/CD47 infusion
      protein HX009, the agent simultaneously and selectively targets and binds to
      PD-1 expressed on T-lymphocytes and CD47 on tumor cells. The CD47 binding by
      HX009 blocks the interaction of CD47 with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha),
      an inhibitory protein expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which
      prevents CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated signaling and abrogates the CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated
      inhibition of phagocytosis. This induces pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by
      the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which is specifically expressed on the surface
      of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP),
      expressed on macrophages, which results in macrophage activation and the specific
      phagocytosis of the CD47-expressing tumor cells. The binding of HX009 to PD-1
      blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and
      PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). This prevents the activation of PD-1 and its downstream
      signaling pathways. This may restore effector T-cell functions and may further
      activate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated tumor cell killing. CD47, also
      called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA),
      widely expressed on normal, healthy cells, such as red blood cells and platelets,
      and overexpressed on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of
      CD47, and its interaction with SIRPalpha, leads to the inhibition of macrophage
      activation and protects cancer cells from phagocytosis, which allows cancer
      cells to proliferate. By co-targeting CD47 and PD-1, HX009 has the potential
      to overcome the limitations of existing CD47-targeted therapies by possibly
      avoiding the side effects caused by binding to CD47 on healthy hematopoietic
      stem cells (HSCs), which causes unwanted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. PD-1,
      an inhibitory receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), is
      expressed on activated T-lymphocytes; it functions as an immune checkpoint that

      cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4), with potential

      anti-PD1/CTLA4 bispecific antibody MEDI5752 targets and binds to both PD-1 and
      CTLA4 expressed on tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), and inhibits the
      PD-1- and CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation.
      In addition, MEDI5752 is internalized and is able to degrade PD-1. This restores
      immune function and activates a sustained cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated
      immune response against tumor cells. Both PD-1 and CTLA4 are selectively expressed
      on TILs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and negatively regulate the activation
      and effector functions of T-cells. They play key roles in the downregulation
      of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. Dual checkpoint blockade
      of PD1 and CTLA4 with MEDI5752 may enhance T-cell activation and proliferation
      more than the blockade of either immune checkpoint receptor alone. It may also
      decrease toxicity by avoiding the binding to CTLA-4-expressing T-cells that
      are devoid of PD-1. The engineered Fc domain may reduce Fc effector function.

  common:
    description: >-
      A monoclonal antibody directed against the receptor activator of nuclear factor
      kappa beta ligand (RANKL) with potential antiosteoclast and antineoplastic activities.
      Upon administration, anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody GB-223 specifically binds
      to RANKL and blocks the interaction of RANKL with RANK, a receptor located on
      osteoclast cell surfaces. This results in the inhibition of osteoclast activity,
      a decrease in bone resorption, and a potential increase in bone mineral density.
      By blocking the activation of the RANK/RANKL-mediated signaling pathway, GB-223
      may also reduce tumor-associated bone destruction and may result in tumor regression
      in bone tumors with high RANK and RANKL expressions. RANKL, a protein expressed
      by osteoblastic cells, plays an important role in osteoclastic differentiation
      and activation. Both RANKL and RANK are overexpressed in certain bone tumors,
      and the RANK/RANKL-mediated signaling pathway plays an important role in certain

      intravenous administration, the monoclonal antibody moiety of NBE-002 targets
      and binds to ROR1 expressed on tumor cells. Upon binding and internalization,
      the anthracycline-based toxin intercalates into DNA and interacts with topoisomerase
      II. This leads to an inhibition of DNA replication and repair, and prevents
      RNA and protein synthesis. This kills the ROR1-expressing cancer cells. In addition,
      the PNU-159682 derivate may promote immunogenic cell death (ICD) and activate
      a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response, thereby

      signaling, and AhR-dependent tumor cell proliferation. Abrogation of AhR activation
      prevents the activation of immune-tolerant dendritic cells (DCs), regulatory
      T-cells (Tregs) and decreases suppressive cytokines in the tumor microenvironment
      (TME). It stimulates cytotoxic T-cell activation and expansion. This may restore
      the immune response against tumor cells. AhR, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim
      (bHLH/PAS) family of transcription factors, plays key roles in regulating immunity
      and cellular differentiation. It mediates the expression of multiple immune

      targets cancer cells, which often lack asparagine synthetase and are dependent
      on an external source of amino acids due to their high metabolic rate. Once
      the prodrug is inside target cells, the cytarabine component is cleaved and
      competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA. The arabinose sugar moiety
      of cytarabine sterically hinders the rotation of the molecule within DNA, resulting
      in cell cycle arrest, specifically during the S phase of replication. Cytarabine
      also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in a decrease in DNA replication and
      repair. Because BST-236 specifically targets cancer cells, it may spare normal
      tissues from cytarabine-related toxicities.

      cells, and expresses SCD, an enzyme that catalyzes the intracellular conversion
      of the prodrug flucytosine (5-fluorocytosine; 5-FC) into the antineoplastic
      agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). After administration of 5-FC, the tumor can be

      infect and lyse tumor cells. In turn, the lysed tumor cells release various
      tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), which induce an immune response against the
      tumor cells. This may further eradicate tumor cells.

autologous_nectin4faptargeted_cart_cells:
  common:
    description: >-
      A preparation of autologous T-lymphocytes engineered to express a chimeric antigen
      receptor (CAR) specific for the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) nectin-4 and
      cell surface protein fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and additionally an
      inducible expression cassette encoding transgenic interleukin (IL) 7 (IL-7)
      or 12 (IL-12), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities.
      Upon intratumoral administration, the autologous nectin-4/FAP-targeted CAR-T
      cells target and bind to nectin-4-expressing tumor cells and FAP-expressing
      cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). This results in a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
      (CTL) response against nectin-4-expressing tumor cells and FAP-expressing CAFs,
      leading to cell lysis of these cells. Upon the binding to nectin-4 and FAP and
      the activation of the CAR-T cells, cytokine IL-7 or IL-12 is also released.
      This further augments the immune responses against the tumor cells, which may
      include the attack of nectin-4-negative tumor cells by tumor necrosis factor
      alpha (TNFa). Nectin-4, a TAA belonging to the nectin family, is overexpressed
      in a variety of cancers, including breast, bladder, lung and pancreatic cancer.
      FAP, a cell surface glycoprotein, is overexpressed on CAFs but minimally expressed
      on normal, healthy cells.

autologous_nkg2d_car_tcells_cyad02:
  common:
    description: >-
      A preparation of autologous T-lymphocytes that have been genetically modified
      and transduced with a retroviral vector to co-express a chimeric antigen receptor
      (CAR) encoding human natural-killer group 2, member D receptor protein (NKG2D
      or KLRK1) with a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting MHC class I chain-related
      protein A (MICA) and MICB, with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon infusion back into the patient, autologous NKG2D CAR T-cells
      CYAD-02 specifically recognize and bind to tumor cells expressing NKG2D ligands,
      resulting in the lysis of NKG2D ligand-expressing tumor cells. In addition,
      CYAD-02 targets, binds to and kills NKG2D ligand expressing tumor-associated
      endothelial cells in the neovasculature and immunosuppressive cells, such as
      regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the
      tumor microenvironment (TME) that express NKG2D ligands. It also activates macrophages
      within the TME. Ligands for NKG2D, such as MICA, MICB, and members of the UL16-binding
      proteins (ULBP)/retinoic acid early transcript 1 (RAET1) family, are overexpressed
      on infected cells and most cancer cell types, but are not expressed on most
      normal, healthy cells. NKG2D, a dimeric, type II transmembrane protein expressed
      on human natural killer (NK) and certain T-cells, in association with the natural
      adaptive protein DAP10, promotes the elimination of NKG2D ligand-expressing
      cells. The shRNA downregulates the expression of MICA and MICB on the CAR-T
      cells, which increases in-vitro cell expansion. This may enhance their persistence
      and increase anti-tumor activity.

      specifically targets and binds to both Axl and Mer, and prevents their activity.
      This blocks Axl- and Mer-mediated signal transduction pathways, and inhibits
      proliferation and migration of Axl- and Mer-overexpressing tumor cells. Axl
      and Mer, both members of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl and Mer) family of RTKs, are overexpressed
      by many tumor cell types. They play key roles in tumor cell proliferation, survival,
      invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis, and their expression is associated with
      drug resistance and poor prognosis.

basal_cell_cancer:
  common:
    description: >-
      The most frequently seen skin cancer. It arises from basal cells of the epidermis
      and pilosebaceous units. Clinically it is divided into the following types:
      nodular, ulcerative, superficial, multicentric, erythematous, and sclerosing
      or morphea-like. More than 95% of these carcinomas occur in patients over 40.
      They develop on hair-bearing skin, most commonly on sun-exposed areas. Approximately
      85% are found on the head and neck and the remaining 15% on the trunk and extremities.
      Basal cell carcinoma usually grows in a slow and indolent fashion. However,
      if untreated, the tumor may invade the subcutaneous fat, skeletal muscle and
      bone. Distant metastases are rare. Excision, curettage and irradiation cure
      most basal cell carcinomas.

      monomethyl auristatin phenylalanine (MMAF), with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon administration of belantamab mafodotin, the anti-BCMA antibody moiety selectively

      A monoclonal antibody directed against common lymphatic endothelial and vascular

      binds to CLEVER-1 that is expressed on tumor endothelial cells. This prevents
      the recruitment, infiltration and attachment of tumor-associated macrophages
      (TAMs) at the tumor site. By preventing the binding of TAMs to tumor cells,
      the infiltration of activated T-regulatory cells (Tregs) to the tumor and the
      TAM-mediated immune suppression is abrogated, leading to the polarization of
      TAM from the immunosuppressive M2 macrophages to the anti-inflammatory and immunostimulatory
      M1 macrophages. This leads to the activation of the immune system, resulting
      in a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response and inhibition of
      tumor cell growth and metastasis. CLEVER-1 is an endothelial cell surface molecule
      involved in immune suppression, cancer growth and metastasis.

bomedemstat:
  common:
    description: >-
      An orally available, irreversible inhibitor of lysine-specific demethylase 1
      (LSD1), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, bomedemstat
      binds to and inhibits LSD1, a demethylase that suppresses the expression of
      target genes by converting the di- and mono-methylated forms of lysine at position
      4 of histone H3 (H3K4) to mono- and unmethylated H3K4. LSD1 inhibition enhances
      H3K4 methylation and increases the expression of tumor suppressor genes. In
      addition, LSD1 demethylates mono- or di-methylated H3K9 which increases gene
      expression of tumor promoting genes; thus, inhibition of LSD1 also promotes
      H3K9 methylation and decreases transcription of these genes. Altogether, this
      may lead to an inhibition of cell growth in LSD1-overexpressing tumor cells.
      LSD1, an enzyme belonging to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent
      amine oxidase family is overexpressed in certain tumor cells and plays a key
      role in the regulation of gene expression, tumor cell growth and survival.

      are equally affected. UV damage and ingestion of inorganic arsenic may play
      a role in the development of the disease. On the skin surface, it presents as
      a single or multiple erythematous, scaly, keratotic patches or plaques. The
      clinical entity of erythroplasia of Queyrat is regarded as Bowen disease of
      the penis and it presents as an asymptomatic, red, circumscribed plaque. Morphologically,
      Bowen disease is characterized by the presence of hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis,
      dyskeratosis, and acanthosis. The keratotic squamous cells are atypical and
      display hyperchromatism and abnormal mitotic figures. The dermoepidermal basement
      membrane is intact. Complete surgical removal of the lesion may be curative.

      the inhibition of an over-activated MAPK signaling pathway downstream in BRAF(V600E)
      kinase-expressing tumor cells and a reduction in tumor cell proliferation. BRAF
      belongs to the raf/mil family of serine/threonine protein kinases and plays
      a role in regulating the MAP kinase/ERKs signaling pathway. The valine to glutamic
      acid substitution at residue 600 accounts for about 90% of BRAF gene mutations.
      The oncogenic product, BRAF(V600E) kinase, exhibits a markedly elevated activity
      that over-activates the MAPK signaling pathway. The BRAF(V600E) mutation has
      been found to occur in about 8% of all tumors.

      B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. This prevents both B-cell activation
      and BTK-mediated activation of downstream survival pathways. This leads to an
      inhibition of the growth of malignant B cells that overexpress BTK. BTK, a member
      of the src-related BTK/Tec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed
      in B-cell malignancies; it plays an important role in B lymphocyte development,
      activation, signaling, proliferation and survival.

calcium_releaseactivated_channel_inhibitor_cm4620:
  common:
    description: >-
      A calcium (Ca2+) release-activated channel (CRAC) inhibitor, with potential
      anti-inflammatory and protective activities. Upon administration, CM4620 targets,
      binds to and inhibits the calcium release-activated calcium channel protein
      1 (Orai1), which forms the pore of CRAC, and is expressed on both parenchymal
      cells and immune cells. This prevents the transport of extracellular Ca2+ into
      the cell and inhibits the subsequent activation of Ca2+-mediated signaling and
      transcription of target genes. This may prevent Ca2+ entry-mediated cell death.
      It may also inhibit the proliferation of immune cells and prevents the release
      of various inflammatory cytokines in immune cells, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2)
      and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). This may lead to a reduction of inflammatory
      responses in inflammatory-mediated diseases. CRACs, specialized plasma membrane
      Ca2+ ion channels composed of the plasma membrane based Orai channels and the
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stromal interaction molecules (STIMs), mediate store
      operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and play a key role in calcium homeostasis. CRACs
      are overactivated in a variety of cell types, especially certain immune cells
      during inflammation, including T-lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages.

      An immunoconjugate consisting of a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody

      or CD25) and conjugated, via a cleavable linker, to a synthetic, cross-linking
      agent pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer that targets DNA minor grooves, with
      potential antineoplastic activity. The monoclonal antibody portion of the anti-CD25
      antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) ADCT-301 specifically binds to the cell surface
      antigen CD25. This causes the internalization of ADCT-301 and the subsequent
      release of the cytotoxic PBD moiety. The imine groups of the PBD moiety bind
      to the N2 positions of guanines on opposite strands of DNA. This induces interstrand
      cross-links in the minor groove of DNA and inhibits DNA replication, which inhibits
      the proliferation of CD25-overexpressing tumor cells. CD25, a transmembrane
      receptor and tumor-associated antigen (TAA), is expressed on certain cancer
      cells.

      immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration,
      CD80-Fc fusion protein ALPN-202 targets and binds to programmed cell death-1
      ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) expressed on tumor cells,
      which blocks its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed cell death
      1 (PD-1; cluster of differentiation 279; CD279), and leads to PD-L1-dependent
      CD28 binding and co-stimulation in the local tumor microenvironment (TME). This
      reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling, leads to the co-stimulation
      of T-cell responses including the activation of naive and memory T-cells in
      the TME and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune
      response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. In addition, ALPN-202 targets
      and binds to CTL-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4) expressed on T-cells.
      This prevents the binding of CTLA-4 to endogenous CD80, thereby enabling CD80-CD28
      engagement, CD28 signaling, and T-cell activation. This further promotes T-cell
      activity. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding
      to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion.
      CD80 is a co-stimulatory molecule expressed on activated antigen presenting
      cells (APCs) that plays a key role in T-cell activation upon binding to CD28
      on T-cells. On the other hand, binding of CD80 to CTLA-4 prevents CD80-CD28
      engagement, thereby inhibiting T-cell activity and immune activation. CTLA-4
      is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and an inhibitory molecule
      upregulated by T-cells following T-cell activation. It plays a key role in the
      downregulation of the immune system.

    description: >-
      An orally bioavailable, selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7),
      with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, SY-5609 selectively
      targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of CDK7, thereby inhibiting CDK7-mediated
      signaling. Specifically, inhibition of CDK7 prevents phosphorylation of the
      carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II, thereby preventing transcription
      of important cancer-promoting genes. In addition, it prevents phosphorylation
      of the cell cycle kinases CDK1, 2, 4, and 6, thereby disrupting uncontrolled
      cell cycle progression. Altogether, this may induce apoptosis, cause cell cycle
      arrest, inhibit DNA damage repair and inhibit tumor cell proliferation in certain
      cancers that are dependent on CDK7-mediated transcriptional regulation and signaling.
      CDK7, a serine/threonine kinase, plays a role in controlling cell cycle progression,
      transcriptional regulation, and promotes the expression of key oncogenes such
      as c-Myc and beta-catenin, through the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II.

      primarily found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver that catalyzes
      the deamination of cytidine and cytidine analogs. This prevents the breakdown
      of azacitidine, increases its bioavailability and efficacy while decreasing
      GI toxicity due to the administration of lower doses of azacitidine. Azacitidine
      exerts its antineoplastic activity through the incorporation of its triphosphate
      form into DNA, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), thereby blocking
      DNA methylation and results in hypomethylation of DNA. This interferes with
      DNA replication and decreases tumor cell growth.

      A modulator of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing cereblon (CRL4-CRBN
      E3 ubiquitin ligase), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities.
      Upon administration, cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase modulating agent CC-99282
      specifically binds to cereblon (CRBN), thereby affecting the ubiquitin E3 ligase
      activity, and targeting certain substrate proteins for ubiquitination. This
      induces proteasome-mediated degradation of certain transcription factors, some
      of which are transcriptional repressors in T-cells. This leads to modulation
      of the immune system, including activation of T-lymphocytes, and downregulation
      of the activity of other proteins, some of which play key roles in the proliferation
      of certain cancer cell types. CRBN, the substrate recognition component of the
      CRL4-CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, plays a key role in the ubiquitination
      of certain proteins.

chlorotoxin_eqcd28cd3zetacd19texpressing_car_tlymphocytes:
  common:
    description: >-
      A preparation of genetically modified T-lymphocytes transduced with a lentiviral
      vector expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) comprised of a CD28 co-stimulatory
      signaling domain fused to the zeta chain of the TCR/CD3 complex (CD3zeta), a
      truncated form of CD19 (CD19t), an immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-Fc (EQ) spacer, and
      a peptide derived from chlorotoxin (CLTX), with potential imaging and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon administration, chlorotoxin (EQ)-CD28-CD3zeta-CD19t-expressing
      CAR T-lymphocytes are re-directed to specific tumor cells in the brain inducing
      selective toxicity in these tumor cells. CLTX, a 36-amino acid peptide found
      in the venom of the deathstalker scorpion (Leiurus quinquestriatus) and a chloride
      channel blocker, preferentially binds to glioma (and other neuroectodermal origin)
      cells via membrane bound forms of the endopeptidase matrix metalloproteinase-2
      (MMP-2). This may direct the T-lymphocytes to and induce selective toxicity
      in MMP-2-expressing tumor cells. Additionally, binding to MMP-2 on glioma cells
      may both interfere with transmembrane chloride exchange and inhibit proteolytic
      extracellular matrix remodeling by MMP-2, which may further limit the spread
      of these tumor cells. MMP-2 is specifically upregulated in gliomas and related
      cancers, but is not normally expressed in brain. The CD28 co-stimulatory molecule
      signaling domain enhances activation and signaling; its inclusion may increase
      proliferation of T-cells and antitumor activity compared to the inclusion of
      the CD3 zeta chain alone. IgG4-Fc (EQ) contains two point mutations in its spacer
      region which prevents recognition of the CAR by Fc receptors (FcRs) without
      altering the ability of the CAR to mediate antigen-specific lysis. CD19t, which
      lacks the cytoplasmic signaling tail, provides a non-immunogenic surface marker
      that allows for accurate measurement, efficient cell tracking and/or imaging
      of the therapeutic T-cells in vivo following adoptive transfer. Additionally,
      co-expression of CD19t functions as a "suicide" switch via clinically available
      antibodies or immunotoxins which can be used to selectively eliminate the genetically
      modified cells.

    description: >-
      A chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the expression of the
      BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. It presents with neutrophilic leukocytosis. It can appear
      at any age, but it mostly affects middle aged and older individuals. Patients
      usually present with fatigue, weight loss, anemia, night sweats, and splenomegaly.
      If untreated, it follows a biphasic or triphasic natural course; an initial
      indolent chronic phase which is followed by an accelerated phase, a blast phase,
      or both. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation and tyrosine kinase inhibitors
      delay disease progression and prolong overall survival.

cintirorgon:
  common:
    description: >-
      An orally bioavailable agonist of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma
      (RORg), with potential immunomodulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon
      oral administration of cintirorgon, this agent selectively binds to the nuclear
      receptor transcription factor RORg, forming a receptor complex that translocates
      to the nucleus, and binds to ROR response elements (ROREs), enhancing the function,
      proliferation and survival of type 17 T-cells, including Th17 (helper T-cells)
      and Tc17 (cytotoxic T-cells). This may increase the expression of co-stimulatory
      molecules and decrease the expression of co-inhibitory molecules on T-cells
      leading to increased production of cytokines and chemokines by T-cells, decreased
      proliferation of regulatory T-cells (Tregs), and abrogation of tumor-induced
      immunosuppression. This ultimately induces a T-cell-mediated immune response
      against cancer cells and leads to a reduction in tumor cell growth. RORg, the
      nuclear receptor transcription factor that is involved in Th17/Tc17 differentiation,
      plays a key role in immune activation.

      The ditosylated salt of A51, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of casein kinase
      1alpha (CK1alpha) and cyclin-dependent kinases 7 and 9 (CDK7 and CDK9), with
      potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, BTX-A51 binds to and
      inhibits the activity of CK1alpha, CDK7, and CDK9. Blocking the phosphorylation
      and kinase activity of CK1alpha prevents the enhanced binding of murine double
      minute X (MDMX) to p53, the formation of CK1alpha and MDM2 complex, and the
      resulting inhibition of p53. This induces p53-mediated cell cycle arrest, slowing
      tumor cell proliferation. Blocking the phosphorylation and kinase activity of
      CDK7 and CDK9 prevents the positive transcription elongation factor b (PTEFb)-mediated
      activation of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and leads to the inhibition of
      gene transcription of various anti-apoptotic proteins. This also induces cell
      cycle arrest and apoptosis, slowing tumor cell proliferation. CK1alpha, a serine/threonine
      kinase and a leukemic stem cell target, acts as a tumor suppressor in several
      cancers through the negative regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and p53.
      It negatively regulates p53 by phosphorylating MDMX, thus enhancing binding
      of MDMX to p53, as well as by forming a complex with MDM2. CDK7, a serine/threonine
      kinase, plays a role in controlling cell cycle progression, transcriptional
      regulation, and promotes the expression of key oncogenes such as c-Myc through
      the phosphorylation of RNA Pol II. CDK9, also a serine/threonine kinase, regulates
      elongation of transcription through phosphorylation of RNA Pol II at serine
      2 (p-Ser2-RNAPII). It is upregulated in various tumor cell types and plays a
      key role in the regulation of RNA Pol II-mediated transcription of anti-apoptotic
      proteins. Tumor cells are dependent on anti-apoptotic proteins for their survival.

      activities. Upon administration, cobolimab binds to TIM-3 expressed on certain
      T-cells, including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). This abrogates T-cell
      inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic
      T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which results in a reduction in tumor growth.

    description: >-
      Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a technique that allows the detection
      of losses and gains in DNA copy number across the entire genome without prior
      knowledge of specific chromosomal abnormalities. Comparative genomic hybridization
      utilizes the hybridization of differentially labeled tumor and reference DNA
      to generate a map of DNA copy number changes in tumor genomes. Comparative genomic
      hybridization is an ideal tool for analyzing chromosomal imbalances in archived
      tumor material and for examining possible correlations between these findings
      and tumor phenotypes. (from Ried et al. J Mol Med 1997 75:801-14)

      to type 2 SSTR, present on the cell membranes of many types of neuroendocrine
      tumor (NET) cells. Upon binding and internalization, this radioconjugate specifically
      delivers a cytotoxic dose of beta radiation to SSTR-positive cells. TATE is
      an octreotide derivative in which phenylalanine at position 3 is substituted
      by tyrosine and position 8 threoninol is replaced with threonine. SSTRs have
      been shown to be present in large numbers on NET and their metastases, while

      cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This reverses
      T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and enhances the cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing
      tumor cells. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding
      to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion.
      PD-1, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed
      on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits
      the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells.

  common:
    description: >-
      A preparation of naturally occurring, oncolytic enterovirus, with potential
      antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, coxsackievirus V937 targets and
      binds to intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and decay acceleration factor
      (DAF), both cell surface molecules that are overexpressed on certain malignant
      cells. After entering the cells, coxsackievirus V937 replicates in these cancer
      cells, thereby causing cancer cell lysis. This results in a reduction of tumor
      cell growth.

      An orally bioavailable inhibitor of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R;
      CSF-1R; CD115; M-CSFR), with potential immunomodulatory and antineoplastic activities.
      Upon administration, CSF1R inhibitor ABSK021 targets and binds to CSF1R, thereby
      blocking CSF1R activation and CSF1R-mediated signaling. This inhibits the activities
      of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells
      (MDSCs), and prevents immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME).
      This enhances antitumor T-cell immune responses and inhibits the proliferation
      of tumor cells. CSF1R, also known as macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor
      (M-CSFR) and CD115 (cluster of differentiation 115), is a cell-surface receptor
      that plays major roles in tumor cell proliferation and metastasis.

      antagonist GMI-1359 binds to both CXCR4 and E-selectin expressed on endothelial
      cells. The binding to CXCR4 prevents the binding of stromal-cell derived factor-1
      (SDF-1; CXCL12) to CXCR4 and inhibits CXCR4 activation, which may result in
      decreased proliferation and migration of CXCR4-expressing tumor cells. The binding
      to E-selectin expressed on endothelial cells prevents their interaction with
      E-selectin ligand-expressing cancer cells. This may prevent tumor cell activation,
      migration and metastasis. CXCR4, a chemokine receptor belonging to the G protein-coupled
      receptor (GPCR) family, plays an important role in chemotaxis and angiogenesis,
      and is upregulated in several tumor cell types. E-selectin is a cell adhesion
      molecule involved in cell rolling, signaling and chemotaxis. Its overexpression
      has been associated with tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in several cancers.

      cytochrome P450 17 (CYP17 or CYP17A1) and CYP11B2, with potential antiandrogen
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration, LAE001 inhibits the
      enzymatic activity of CYP17A1 in both the testes and adrenal glands, thereby
      inhibiting androgen production. This may decrease androgen-dependent growth
      signaling and may inhibit cell proliferation of androgen-dependent tumor cells.
      LAE001 also inhibits the enzymatic activity of CYP11B2, thereby inhibiting aldosterone
      production. This may reduce the elevated aldosterone levels resulting from CYP17
      inhibition and androgen deprivation, leading to a reduction in mineralocorticoid
      side effects including cardiovascular complications. The cytochrome P450 enzyme
      CYP17A1, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, exhibits both 17alpha-hydroxylase
      and 17,20-lyase activities, and plays a key role in the steroidogenic pathway
      that produces steroidal hormones. The cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP11B2, aldosterone
      synthase, is an enzyme that plays a key role in aldosterone biosynthesis.

      (rHuPH20), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon subcutaneous administration
      of daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj, daratumumab targets and binds to CD38
      on certain CD38-expressing tumors, such as multiple myeloma (MM) and plasma
      cell leukemia. This binding induces direct apoptosis through Fc-mediated cross-linking
      and triggers immune-mediated tumor cell lysis through antibody-dependent cellular
      cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and antibody-dependent
      cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) immune responses. CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein,
      is expressed in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic lineage cells. Hyaluronidase-fihj
      hydrolyzes and degrades the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid (HA), thereby
      decreasing interstitial viscosity and enhancing penetration of daratumumab through
      the interstitial space. This facilitates the delivery of daratumumab to CD38-expressing
      tumor cells.

      activity through the incorporation of its triphosphate form into DNA, which

delolimogene_mupadenorepvec:
  common:
    description: >-
      A double-armed oncolytic adenovirus composed of a recombinant genetically modified
      E1/E3-deleted, adenoviral serotype 5 (Ad5) vector, with the L5 segment of the
      Ad5 fiber replaced by the shaft and knob from the Ad35 serotype (Ad5/35), which
      expresses a trimerized (TMZ) form of the membrane-bound immunostimulator CD40
      ligand (CD40L; TNFSF5) and the ligand for the signaling domain 4-1BB (4-1BBL;
      CD137L; TNFSF9), under the control of a CMV promoter, with potential immunostimulating
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon intratumoral administration of delolimogene
      mupadenorepvec, the virus infects and selectively replicates in tumor cells.
      This causes direct oncolysis and the release of a plethora of tumor-associated
      antigens (TAAs) from the tumor cells. The released TAAs stimulate the immune
      system and activate anti-tumor cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), thereby further
      killing tumor cells. In addition, infected tumor cells and tumor stroma cells,
      including stellate cells and infiltrating immune cells, express the immunostimulants
      CD40L and 4-1BBL. The expressed CD40L and 4-1BBL proteins activate the CD40L-
      and 4-1BBL-mediated signaling pathways, respectively. This activates antigen-presenting
      cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and M1 macrophages. The DCs produce
      various cytokines, including interleukin-12 (IL12), IL21, tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      (TNFa), and interferon-gamma (IFNg), which leads to the activation and expansion
      of both T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Altogether, this modulates immune
      suppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME), disrupts tumor stroma, and
      causes additional immune stimulation against tumor cells, thereby inducing further
      tumor cell lysis. In addition, CD40L reduces myeloid suppressor cells in the
      TME. Inclusion of the chimeric Ad5/35 fiber targets CD46 and increases viral
      uptake in cells. Transgene expression is driven by a separate promoter to allow
      for efficient expression in both tumor cells and tumor stroma. Replication is
      restricted to tumor cells by the presence of the delta24 mutation in the E1A
      gene, which deletes the retinoplastoma protein (pRb)-binding domain and forces
      viral replication to be conditional on hyperphosphorylated pRb and a dysfunctional
      Rb pathway.

      poly-lysine dendrimer via a hydrolytically labile linker, with potential pro-apoptotic
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of AZD0466, AZD4320 is released
      through hydrolytic cleavage of the linker. AZD4320 is a Bcl2-homology domain
      3 (BH3) mimetic that specifically binds to and inhibits the activity of the
      anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. This restores apoptotic processes
      and inhibits cell proliferation in Bcl-2/Bcl-XL-dependent tumor cells. Bcl-2
      and Bcl-XL, proteins belonging to the Bcl-2 family that are overexpressed in
      many cancers, play an important role in the negative regulation of apoptosis.
      Their expression in tumors is associated with increased drug resistance and
      cancer cell survival. The conjugation of AZD 4320 to the dendrimer construct
      may allow extended release of the agent, which may improve efficacy and lower
      toxicity.

    description: >-
      An orally bioavailable ATP-competitive inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase
      (DNA-PK), with potential chemo/radiosensitizing and antineoplastic activites.
      Upon oral administration, DNA-PK inhibitor AZD7648 selectively targets, binds
      to and inhibits the activity of DNA-PK, thereby interfering with the non-homologous
      end joining (NHEJ) process and preventing repair of DNA double strand breaks
      (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic treatment. This increases
      chemo- and radiotherapy cytotoxicity leading to enhanced tumor cell death. AZD7648
      may also increase the effect of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors
      and may work as a monotherapy in tumors with high endogenous levels of DNA damage
      resulting from defects in other DNA repair pathways. The enhanced ability of
      tumor cells to repair DSBs plays a major role in the resistance of tumor cells
      to chemo- and radiotherapy. DNA-PK plays a key role in the NHEJ pathway and
      DSB repair.

dnapkpi3kdelta_inhibitor_br101801:

      An orally bioavailable inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3-kinase
      subunit delta; PI3K-delta; PI3Kdelta) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK),
      with potential antineoplastic and immunomodulating activities. Upon oral administration,
      the DNA-PK/PI3K-delta inhibitor BR101801 inhibits the activity of both PI3K-delta
      and DNA-PK. This prevents PI3K-mediated signaling pathways and may lead to the
      inhibition of cancer cell growth in PI3K-overexpressing tumor cells. Specifically,
      since PI3K regulates c-myc expression, inhibition of PI3K signaling may lead
      to a decrease in proliferation of c-myc-expressing tumor cells. Also, by inhibiting
      the activity of DNA-PK, this agent interferes with the non-homologous end joining
      (NHEJ) process and prevents the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) caused
      by ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic treatment. This increases chemo- and
      radiotherapy cytotoxicity by inhibiting the ability of tumor cells to repair
      damaged DNA. The PI3K pathway is upregulated in a variety of tumors and plays
      an important role in regulating cancer cell proliferation, growth, and survival.
      DNA-PK is activated upon DNA damage and plays a key role in repairing double-stranded
      DNA breaks. The enhanced ability of tumor cells to repair DSBs plays a major
      role in the resistance of tumor cells to chemo- and radiotherapy. In addition,
      BR101801 is able to decrease Tregs and increase CD8 lymphocytes.

      This may prevent DNA methylation, induce DNA hypomethylation, and activate tumor
      suppressor genes silenced by hypermethylation. This may inhibit tumor cell proliferation.
      DNMT1, a member of the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) family, plays an important

dociparstat_sodium:
  common:
    description: >-
      A heparin derivative in which the 2-O and 3-O sulfate groups of heparin are
      removed and that lacks anticoagulant activity, with potential anti-inflammatory,
      immodulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, dociparstat
      sodium binds to both chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12)
      and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). This prevents the interaction of CXCL12
      with CXCR4, blocks CXCR4 activation, and may result in decreased proliferation
      and migration in CXCR4-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, inhibition of
      CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction may induce mobilization of hematopoietic cells from
      the bone marrow into the blood.  In addition, dociparstat sodium prevents the
      interaction of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) with
      its ligands, including advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), Mac-1(CD11b/CD18),
      the nuclear pro-inflammatory protein high mobility group box protein-1 (HMGB-1),
      carboxymethyl lysine-bovine serum albumin (CML-BSA) and members of the S100
      calgranulin family. In addition, this agent inhibits the enzymes heparanase,
      cathepsin G, and human leukocyte elastase, which are involved in inflammation
      and metastasis. Altogether, this may inhibit tumor cell invasiveness and metastasis.
      Dociparstat sodium also binds to platelet factor 4 (PF4 or CXCL4) and may prevent
      PF4's inhibitory effect on platelet production. This may increase platelet production.
      Unlike heparin, this agent does not induce heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
      (HIT). RAGE, a receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, plays a
      key role in inflammation and is overexpressed in a variety of cancers. CXCR4
      is a chemokine receptor belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family
      that plays an important role in chemotaxis, chemoresistance and angiogenesis,
      and is upregulated in several tumor cell types. The interaction between CXCL12/CXCR4
      induces retention of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow.

      (BTK) inhibitor, everolimus, a mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor,
      and pomalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), that may be used for the
      treatment of B-cell malignancies. Upon oral administration of DTRM-555, the
      DTRMWXHS-12 component inhibits the activity of BTK and prevents the activation
      of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. This prevents both B-cell
      activation and BTK-mediated activation of downstream survival pathways, and
      leads to an inhibition of the growth of malignant B-cells that overexpress BTK.
      BTK plays an important role in the development, activation, signaling, proliferation
      and survival of B-lymphocytes. The everolimus component binds to the immunophilin
      FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12) to generate a complex that binds to and inhibits
      the activation of mTOR, a key regulatory kinase. Upregulated in some tumors,
      mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase involved in regulating cellular proliferation,
      motility, and survival that is located downstream of the PI3K/Akt signaling
      pathway. The pomalidomide component may inhibit TNF-alpha production, enhance
      the activity of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells and enhance antibody-dependent
      cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In addition, pomalidomide may inhibit tumor angiogenesis,
      promote cell cycle arrest in susceptible tumor cell populations, and stimulate
      erythropoiesis. The combination of a BTK inhibitor, an mTOR inhibitor and an
      IMiD may work synergistically to kill malignant B-cells and prevent drug resistance.

      DCIS. In this classification the DCIS grade is defined by a combination of nuclear
      grade, architectural growth pattern and presence of necrosis.  The size of the
      lesion as well as the grade and the clearance margins play a major role in dictating
      the most appropriate therapy for DCIS.

edicotinib:
  common:
    description: >-
      A small molecule and orally available inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor-1
      receptor (CSF1R; FMS) with potential antineoplastic activity. Edicotinib blocks
      the receptor-ligand interaction between FMS and its ligand CSF1, thereby preventing
      autophosphorylation of FMS. As a result, unphosphorylated FMS can not activate
      FMS-mediated signaling pathways, thus potentially inhibiting cell proliferation
      in FMS-overexpressed tumor cells. FMS, a tyrosine kinase receptor, is overexpressed
      in certain tumor cell types and plays an essential role in macrophage differentiation,
      recruitment, and activation as well as the regulation of cell proliferation.

      shows similar activity against certain activating mutations, including exon
      20 insertions (exon20ins), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral

      regression in EGFR/HER2-expressing tumors. EGFR and HER2 are receptor tyrosine
      kinases that play major roles in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.
      In contrast to other agents active against exon20ins mutations, DZD9008 appears
      to be more selective against mutated EGFR than wild-type (wt) EGFR. This may

      and EGFR-dependent tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. The anti-TGFb moiety
      targets and binds to TGFb, thereby preventing the activation of TGFb-mediated
      signaling pathways. This may inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in which
      TGFb is overactivated. EGFR and TGFb, mutated and/or overexpressed on the surfaces
      of various tumor cell types, play key roles in tumor cell proliferation and

      particles of the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin incorporated into a pH-sensitive
      poly(methyl methacrylate) polymer, with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon oral administration of the encapsulated rapamycin, the nanoparticle
      specifically delivers rapamycin at the tumor site. Rapamycin binds to the immunophilin
      FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12) to generate a complex that binds to and inhibits
      the activation of the serine/threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin
      (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. This may suppress mTORC1 activity. In addition,
      inhibition of mTOR may modulate central memory CD8 T cells, CD3+/CD56+ natural
      killer (NK) cells and CD8 T-cell responses. This may kill tumor cells. Compared
      to the administration of rapamycin alone, this formulation improves oral bioavailability
      of rapamycin with more consistent rapamycin levels, thereby allowing for administration
      of lower rapamycin dosage, which improves and minimizes rapamycin's toxicity.
      Upregulated in some tumors, mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase involved in regulating
      cellular proliferation, motility, and survival that is located downstream of
      the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

      on tumor cells. This activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic
      T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which leads to a reduction in tumor growth.
      LAG3, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), is expressed on various

      An orally bioavailable, dual antagonist of the human prostaglandin E2 receptor
      subtypes 2 (EP2) and 4 (EP4), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon oral administration, the EP2/EP4 antagonist TPST-1495 selectively
      targets and binds to EP2 and EP4, inhibiting the binding of the immunosuppressive
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to EP2 and EP4. This prevents the activation of EP2
      and EP4, and inhibits PGE2-EP2/EP4-mediated signaling. This inhibits PGE2-driven
      immune suppression by preventing the PGE2-mediated inhibition of anti-tumor
      immune effector cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as natural killer
      (NK) cells, T-lymphocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and M1 macrophages, and blocking
      the PGE2-mediated increase in suppressive immune cells, such as myeloid derived
      suppressor cells (MDSCs), M2 macrophages, and regulatory T cells (Tregs). This
      inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells in which the PGE2-EP2/4 signaling
      pathway is over-activated. EP2 and EP4, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
      that are overexpressed in certain types of cancers, promote tumor cell proliferation,
      invasion, survival, and metastasis.

      the EP4 antagonist INV-1120 selectively targets and binds to EP4, inhibiting
      the binding of the immunosuppressive prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to EP4. This prevents
      the activation of EP4 and inhibits PGE2-EP4-mediated signaling, thereby inhibiting
      proliferation of tumor cells in which the PGE2-EP4 signaling pathway is over-activated.
      In addition, EP4 inhibition prevents the activity of tumor-associated myeloid
      cells (TAMCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) by inhibiting interleukin-23
      (IL-23) production and the IL-23-mediated expansion of Th17 cells. EP4, a prostanoid
      receptor, is a G protein-coupled receptor that is expressed in certain types
      of cancers; it promotes tumor cell proliferation and invasion.

      of the serine/threonine-protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2, thereby preventing the
      phosphorylation of ERK1/2 substrates and the activation of mitogen-activated
      protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK-mediated signal transduction pathways. This results
      in the inhibition of ERK-dependent proliferation and survival of tumor cells.
      The MAPK/ERK pathway, also known as the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, is hyperactivated
      in a variety of tumor cell types due to mutations in upstream targets. It plays

etigilimab:
  common:
    description: >-
      A monoclonal antibody targeting the human co-inhibitory molecule and immune
      checkpoint inhibitor T-cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin (Ig) and immunoreceptor
      tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) domains (TIGIT), with potential immune
      checkpoint inhibitory activity. Upon administration, etigilimab binds to TIGIT
      expressed on various immune cells, including T-cells, and prevents the interaction
      of TIGIT with its ligands CD112 (nectin-2; poliovirus receptor related-2; PVRL2)
      and CD155 (poliovirus receptor; PVR; nectin-like protein 5; NECL-5). This enhances
      the interaction of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX
      Accessory molecule-1; DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune cells, such as natural
      killer (NK) cells and CD8-positive T-cells, and leads to CD226 dimerization
      and CD226-mediated signaling. This activates the immune system to exert a T-cell-mediated
      immune response against cancer cells. TIGIT, a member of the Ig super family
      and an immune inhibitory receptor, plays a key role in the suppression of T-cell
      proliferation and activation; it is involved in tumor cell immune evasion and
      the inhibition of antiviral immune responses.

      An extended-release (ER) tablet composed of the hydrochloride salt form of the
      biguanide metformin, with antihyperglycemic and potential prostate-cancer protective
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration, metformin targets and
      inhibits complex I (NADPH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the mitochondrial respiratory
      chain and increases the cellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP) ratio leading to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase
      (AMPK). This modulates AMPK-mediated transcription of target genes, which prevents
      hepatic gluconeogenesis, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, enhances
      insulin sensitivity and fatty acid oxidation, and increases glucose uptake and
      utilization in target tissues. This lowers blood glucose levels. Metformin may
      exert antineoplastic effects through AMPK-mediated or AMPK-independent inhibition
      of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is up-regulated in many cancer
      tissues. It also reduces cyclin D1. This inhibits cancer cell proliferation.
      Furthermore, this agent also inhibits tumor cell migration and invasion by inhibiting
      matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression which is mediated through the
      suppression of transcription activator protein-1 (AP-1) activation. Also, metformin
      reduces hyperinsulinemia which may contribute to an anti-tumor effect. Metformin
      may increase the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time and may lower
      serum PSA levels.

      sinuses, and larynx. Other sites of involvement include the gastrointestinal
      tract, central nervous system, breast, skin, lymph nodes, and bladder.  A minority
      of patients have a monoclonal gammopathy. Treatment includes radiation therapy.
      Progression to plasma cell myeloma occurs in a minority of patients.

      An autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by the presence of multiple adenomas
      in the colon and rectum. It is caused by a germline mutation in the adenomatous
      polyposis coli (APC) gene which is located on the long arm of chromosome 5.
      The adenomas are most often tubular, and they have the tendency to progress
      to adenocarcinoma. They can occur throughout the colon, but they tend to concentrate
      in the rectum and sigmoid colon. The colorectal adenomas are detected during
      endoscopic examination between the age of 10 and 20 years. The adenomas increase
      in size and numbers with age, and there is usually progression of one or more
      adenomas to adenocarcinoma. The mean age of development of adenocarcinoma is
      about 40 years. Signs include rectal bleeding and mucousy diarrhea.

fianlimab:
  common:
    description: >-
      A monoclonal antibody directed against the inhibitory receptor lymphocyte activation
      gene-3 protein (LAG-3; LAG3; CD223), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, fianlimab binds to LAG-3
      expressed by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and blocks LAG-3 binding
      to tumor cells expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules.
      This may activate antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhance cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
      (CTL)-mediated tumor cell lysis, which leads to a reduction in tumor growth.
      LAG-3, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), is expressed on various
      immune cells; its expression on TILs is associated with tumor-mediated immune
      suppression and the negative regulation of both cellular proliferation and T-cell
      activation.

  common:
    description: >-
      An oncolytic vaccinia virus (VV; VACV) genetically engineered to express an
      Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) ligand, an antibody directed against the human
      T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)
      and the human pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12), with potential
      immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of the Flt3
      ligand/anti-CTLA-4 antibody/IL-12 engineered oncolytic VV RIVAL-01, the virus
      preferentially targets, infects and replicates in tumor cells, causing oncolysis.
      In turn, the lysed tumor cells release various tumor-associated antigens (TAAs),
      which induce an immune response against the tumor cells. In addition, the Flt3
      ligand, the anti-ctla-4 antibody and IL-12 are expressed by the VV in the cancer
      cells and may activate the immune system within the tumor microenvironment (TME),
      thereby stimulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. The anti-CTLA-4
      antibody targets and binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated
      downregulation of T-cell activation, which promotes T-cell activation. Flt3
      ligand binds to the Flt3 tyrosine kinase receptor and promotes Flt3 signaling
      which plays an important role in expanding the population of antigen-presenting
      dendritic cells (DCs). IL-12 activates natural killer cells (NKs), induces the
      secretion of interferon-gamma and promotes CD8 cytotoxic T-cell responses against
      tumor cells, which may result in immune-mediated tumor cell death and inhibition
      of tumor cell proliferation.

      this agent binds to and inhibits both FGFR and FLT3, including FLT3 mutant forms,
      which results in the inhibition of FGFR/FLT3-mediated signal transduction pathways.
      This inhibits proliferation in FGFR/FLT3-overexpressing tumor cells. FGFR, a
      family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is upregulated in many tumor cell types.
      FLT3, a class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), is overexpressed or mutated

      (SCFR; KIT) and colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R; CSF-1R; C-FMS;
      CD115; M-CSFR), with potential antineoplastic and immunomodulating activities
      Upon administration, FLT3/KIT/CSF1R inhibitor NMS-03592088 binds to and inhibits
      the activity of FLT3, KIT and CSF1R. This prevents FLT3, KIT and CSF1R-mediated
      signaling and results in the inhibition of proliferation in tumor cells overexpressing
      FLT3, KIT and CSF1R. In addition, NMS-03592088 binds to CSF1R expressed on monocytes,
      macrophages, and osteoclasts and inhibits the binding of the CSF1R ligands colony-stimulating
      factor-1 (CSF-1) and interleukin-34 (IL-34), to CSF1R. This prevents CSF1R activation
      and CSF1R-mediated signaling in these cells. This blocks the production of inflammatory
      mediators by macrophages and monocytes and reduces inflammation. By blocking
      the recruitment to the tumor microenvironment and activity of CSF1R-dependent
      tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), NMS-03592088 inhibits the immunomodulating
      activity by macrophages and enhances T-cell infiltration and antitumor T-cell
      immune responses, which inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells. FLT3, a class
      III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), is overexpressed or mutated in most B lineage
      neoplasms and in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and plays a key role in tumor
      cell proliferation. c-Kit, a transmembrane protein and receptor tyrosine kinase,
      is overexpressed in solid tumors and hematological malignancies; it plays a
      key role in the regulation of cell differentiation and proliferation. CSF1R,
      also known as macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) and CD115
      (cluster of differentiation 115), is a cell-surface receptor for its ligand
      colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) and plays major roles in tumor cell proliferation
      and metastasis.

fosgemcitabine_palabenamide:
  common:
    description: >-
      A pyrimidine analogue and a proprietary prodrug based on an aryloxy phosphoramidate
      derivative of gemcitabine with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous
      administration and cellular uptake, fosgemcitabine palabenamide is converted
      into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine di- and triphosphate (dFdCDP,
      dFdCTP). dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide
      pool available for DNA replication; dFdCTP is incorporated into DNA, resulting
      in premature termination of DNA replication and eventually induction of apoptosis.
      With the phosphoramidate moiety on the gemcitabine monophosphate group, NUC-1031
      has improved properties over its parent molecule: 1) is more lipophilic and
      accumulates in cancer cells by passive diffusion and does not require a nucleoside
      transporter, 2) as the agent is delivered in the monophosphate form, the first
      phosphorylation step by deoxycytidine kinase is not required, 3) this agent
      is not susceptible to deactivation by cytidine deaminase cleavage of the monophosphorylated
      form. Altogether, this may help overcome resistance to gemcitabine.

fosifloxuridine_nafalbenamide:
  common:
    description: >-
      A phosphoramidate-based prodrug of the monophosphate (MP) form of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine
      (FUdR; FUDR), the active metabolite of fluorouracil (5-FU), an antimetabolite
      fluoropyrimidine analog of the pyrimidine nucleoside, with potential antineoplastic
      activity. Upon administration of the nucleotide analog prodrug fosifloxuridine
      nafalbenamide, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide is readily taken up by tumor cells.
      In the tumor cell, the phosphoramidate moiety is removed and fosifloxuridine
      nafalbenamide is converted to its active form FUDR-MP. In turn, FUDR-MP binds
      to and inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), resulting in the depletion of thymidine
      triphosphate (TTP) and thus DNA synthesis. With the phosphoramidate moiety attached
      to FUDR-MP, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide, compared to 5-FU, is more lipophilic
      and accumulates in cancer cells by passive diffusion and does not require a
      nucleoside transporter, thereby generating higher intracellular concentrations.
      In addition, compared to 5-FU, once inside the cell FUDR-MP does not need to
      be phosphorylated and is already in its active form. Unlike 5-FU, fosifloxuridine
      nafalbenamide does not get deactivated or converted into toxic metabolites by
      dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and thymidine phosphorylase (TP), which
      leads to both a longer half-life and less toxicity.

      signaling pathways, triggers the proliferation and activation of antigen-presenting
      cells (APCs), and activates T-cells. This results in an enhanced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
      (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. CD40, a cell surface receptor
      and member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), is expressed

      glutamate and glutamate metabolites to provide energy and generate building

glutamine_antagonist_drp104:
  common:
    description: >-
      A broad acting glutamine antagonist, with potential immunomodulatory and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon administration, DON (6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine), the active
      moiety of DRP-104, irreversibly inhibits multiple enzymes involved in glutamine
      metabolism. Blocking glutamine metabolism inhibits proliferation in rapidly
      growing tumor cells and leads to an induction of cell death. Unlike normal healthy
      cells, glutamine-dependent tumors rely heavily on the intracellular conversion
      of exogenous glutamine into glutamate and glutamate metabolites to both provide
      energy and generate building blocks for the production of macromolecules, which
      are needed for cellular growth and survival. In addition, blocking glutamine
      metabolism leads to the accumulation of glutamine in tumor cells and increases
      glutamine concentration in the tumor microenvironment (TME) upon tumor cell
      death. As glutamine is essential for T-cell generation, DON may also enhance
      T-cell proliferation and activation in the TME, which may lead to further killing
      of tumor cells. The conversion of DRP-104 to the active moiety DON occurs primarily
      in tumor cells, allowing glutamine metabolism in healthy cells which may lessen
      adverse effects.

      and diffuse pattern. In females, it affects middle aged to post-menopausal women.
      Signs and symptoms include abdominal mass, hemoperitoneum, and ascites. Estrogenic
      and rarely androgenic manifestations may be present. The vast majority of cases
      present as stage I tumors; however, all tumors have a potential for aggressive
      clinical course. In males, it is reported in the age range of 16-76 years and
      the average age at presentation is 44 years. A minority of patients have gynecomastia.

      granulosa cells, with the latter constituting at least ten percent of the neoplasm.
      The vast majority of cases are stage I lesions at presentation and produce either
      estrogenic or androgenic manifestations. Although it may present as a massive
      ovarian tumor, it usually follows a benign clinical course. Very rare case reports
      of testicular lesions morphologically resembling gynandroblastomas are in fact
      variants of juvenile granulose cell tumor, or Sertoli cell tumor, or a combination
      of both.

    description: >-
      A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is

      the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and
      even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females
      and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.
      Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present
      as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically,
      there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated
      to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize
      to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver
      cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular
      carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of

      and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.
      Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present
      as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically,
      there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated
      to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize
      to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver
      cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular
      carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of
      tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

      prevents HER2-mediated signaling and leads to cell death in HER2-expressing
      tumor cells. HER2, a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed on a variety of
      tumor cell types, plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor
      vascularization.

      therapies (TriNKET) that is directed against human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2 (EGFR2; HER2; ErbB2), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon administration, HER2 tri-specific NK cell engager DF1001 targets
      and binds to HER2 on tumor cells and simultaneously binds to NK cells, thereby
      bringing HER2-expressing tumor cells and NK cells together, which stimulates
      the NK cells and results in the selective NK cell-mediated tumor cell lysis
      of HER2-expressing tumor cells. The binding of HER2-expressing tumor cells and
      NK cells may also lead to the activation of T-cells and B-cells, potentiating
      the immune response against HER2-expressing tumor cells. HER2, a receptor tyrosine
      kinase (RTK) mutated or overexpressed in many tumor cell types, plays a key
      role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.

her2directed_tlr8_agonist_sbt6050:
  common:
    description: >-
      An immunotherapeutic composed of a monoclonal antibody directed against the
      tumor-associated antigen (TAA) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (EGFR2;
      HER2; ErbB2) conjugated to a Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8; CD288) agonist, with
      potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon intravenous
      administration of the HER2-directed TLR8 agonist SBT6050, the anti-HER2 monoclonal
      antibody targets and binds to HER2 expressed on tumor cells, thereby localizing
      the TLR8 agonist directly to the tumor site. In turn, the TLR8 agonist moiety
      binds to TLR8 expressed on myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME).
      This activates myeloid cells, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs),
      myeloid cell-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs), and conventional dendritic cells
      (cDCs). This may lead to the activation of nuclear factor NF-kappa-B, the production
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, macrophage-induced tumor cell
      killing, inflammasome activation, activation of cytolytic natural killer (NK)
      cells and neutrophils, and the induction of a Th1-weighted anti-tumor immune
      response. It also reverses the suppression of senescent naive and tumor-specific
      T-cells, and enhances the anti-tumor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) immune response.
      TLR8, like other TLRs, recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
      and plays a key role in innate and adaptive immunity. HER2, a tyrosine kinase
      receptor, is overexpressed by many cancer cell types.

      function in antigen presentation to regulatory T cells in the immune response
      and in self/nonself discrimination. Invariant alpha and polymorphic beta chains
      have glycosylated N-termini, hydrophobic membrane regions, and hydrophilic C-termini.
      The heterodimer consists of 4 extracellular domains; invariant alpha-1, polymorphic
      N-terminal beta-1, and conserved Ig-like alpha-2 and beta-2. Alpha-1 and alpha-2
      contain disulfide loops. Beta-1 contains 2 small variable regions. Alpha sequences

hyaluronidasezzxfpertuzumabtrastuzumab:
  common:
    description: >-
      A ready-to-use fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab, both recombinant
      humanized monoclonal antibodies directed against the tyrosine kinase receptor
      (TKR) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; HER-2; receptor tyrosine-protein
      kinase erbB-2), and hyaluronidase-zzxf, a biosimilar of the recombinant form
      of the naturally occurring endoglycosidase hyaluronidase, with antineoplastic
      activity that can be used for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers.
      Upon subcutaneous administration, hyaluronidase-zzxf temporarily breaks down
      the hyaluronan barrier, which decreases viscosity of, and allows both pertuzumab
      and trastuzumab to spread rapidly through the interstitial space. This improves
      access to lymphatic and capillary vessels and facilitates the absorption of
      both antibodies into the bloodstream. Pertuzumab targets and binds to the extracellular
      dimerization domain (subdomain II) of HER2 and blocks ligand-dependent heterodimerization
      of HER2 with other HER family members, including EGFR, HER3 and HER4. This inhibits
      ligand-initiated intracellular signaling and prevents the activation of the
      mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
      signaling pathways, leading to growth arrest and apoptosis in HER2-overexpressing
      tumor cells, respectively. Trastuzumab targets and binds to subdomain IV of
      HER2 and inhibits ligand-independent, HER2 mediated cell proliferation and inhibits
      the PI3K signaling pathway in HER2-overexpressing tumor cells. Both antibodies
      induce an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HER2-expressing
      tumor cells. HER2 is overexpressed in many adenocarcinomas, particularly breast
      adenocarcinomas.

      An orally available inhibitor of lysine specific histone demethylase 1 (KDM1A;
      LSD1), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, iadademstat
      binds to and inhibits LSD1, a demethylase that suppresses the expression of
      target genes by converting the di- and mono-methylated forms of lysine at position
      4 of histone H3 (H3K4) to mono- and unmethylated H3K4, respectively. LSD1 inhibition
      enhances H3K4 methylation and increases the expression of tumor suppressor genes.
      This may lead to an inhibition of cell growth in LSD1-overexpressing tumor cells.
      In addition, LSD1 demethylates mono- or di-methylated H3K9, which increases
      gene expression of tumor promoting genes; inhibition of LSD1 promotes H3K9 methylation
      and decreases transcription of these genes. LSD1, an enzyme belonging to the
      flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent amine oxidase family, is overexpressed
      in certain tumor cells and plays a key role in in the regulation of gene expression,
      tumor cell growth and survival.

idetrexed:
  common:
    description: >-
      An alpha-folate receptor (aFR)-mediated inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS),
      with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous infusion, idetrexed
      selectively targets and binds to aFR-expressing tumor cells. Upon uptake by
      aFR, this agent binds to and inhibits TS. This reduces thymine nucleotide synthesis,
      inhibits both DNA synthesis and cell division, and leads to tumor cell apoptosis.
      TS catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine
      monophosphate (dTMP), an essential precursor for DNA synthesis, and plays a
      key role in cell growth and division. aFR, a cell-surface receptor glycoprotein,
      is overexpressed on various tumor cell types, but is minimally expressed by
      normal, healthy tissue.

      An orally available inhibitor of mutant form of the isocitrate dehydrogenase
      type 1 (IDH1; IDH-1; IDH1 [NADP+] soluble), including the substitution mutation
      at arginine (R) in position 132, IDH1(R132), with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon oral administration, IDH1 mutant inhibitor LY3410738 specifically and covalently
      binds to and modifies a single cysteine (Cys269) in the allosteric binding pocket
      of mutant forms of IDH1, thereby inactivating IDH1. This inhibits the formation
      of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) from alpha-ketoglutarate (a-KG).
      This depletes 2-HG levels, prevents 2HG-mediated signaling and leads to both
      an induction of cellular differentiation and an inhibition of cellular proliferation
      in tumor cells expressing mutant forms of IDH1. In addition, LY3410738 has the
      ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). IDH1 mutations, including IDH1(R132)
      mutations, are highly expressed in certain malignancies, including gliomas;
      they initiate and drive cancer growth by both blocking cell differentiation
      and catalyzing the formation of 2HG.

      and rate-limiting step in the production of the immunosuppressive transcription
      factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand kynurenine (Kyn). This inhibits
      the IDO1/TDO2-Kyn-AhR pathway and abrogates AhR activation. This prevents the
      activation of immune-tolerant dendritic cells (DCs) and regulatory T-cells (Tregs)
      in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and may restore the immune response by
      stimulating a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) immune response against tumor cells
      in which IDO1 and/or TDO2 are overexpressed. The IDO1/TDO2-KYN-AhR pathway is

      1 (IDO1; IDO-1) and the kynurenine-producing hepatic enzyme tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase
      (TDO), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration,
      IDO1/TDO inhibitor LY-01013 specifically targets and binds to both IDO1, a cytosolic
      enzyme responsible for the oxidation of the amino acid tryptophan into the immunosuppressive
      metabolite kynurenine, and TDO, a hepatic enzyme catalyzing the first step of
      tryptophan degradation. By inhibiting IDO1 and TDO, LY-01013 decreases kynurenine
      levels in tumor cells, restores tryptophan and promotes the proliferation and
      activation of various immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), natural
      killer (NK) cells and T-lymphocytes. This reduces the number of tumor-associated
      regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and activates the immune system to induce a cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the IDO1/TDO-expressing tumor cells, thereby
      inhibiting the growth of the tumor cells. IDO1 and TDO, both overexpressed by
      multiple tumor cell types, play important roles in immunosuppression and the
      promotion of tumor cell survival and proliferation. Tryptophan depletion inhibits
      T-lymphocyte proliferation and activation, and subsequently suppresses the immune
      system.

      An orally bioavailable, small molecule inhibitor of Janus-associated kinase

      competes with ATP for binding to JAK2 as well as the mutated form JAK2V617F,
      thereby inhibiting the activation of JAK2 and downstream molecules in the JAK2/STAT3
      (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) signaling pathway that
      plays an important role in normal development, particularly hematopoiesis. In
      addition, ilginatinib inhibits the Src family tyrosine kinases. This eventually
      leads to the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. JAK2 is the most common mutated
      gene in bcr-abl-negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs); JAK2V617F is a
      constitutively activated kinase that activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway
      and dysregulates cell growth and function, and its expression transforms hematopoietic
      cells to cytokine-independent growth.

      imaradenant selectively binds to and inhibits A2AR expressed on T-lymphocytes.
      This blocks tumor-released adenosine from interacting with A2AR and prevents
      the adenosine/A2AR-mediated inhibition of T-lymphocytes. This results in the
      proliferation and activation of T-lymphocytes, and stimulates a T-cell-mediated
      immune response against tumor cells. A2AR, a G protein-coupled receptor, is
      highly expressed on the cell surfaces of T-cells and, upon activation by adenosine,
      inhibits T-cell proliferation and activation. Adenosine is often overproduced
      by cancer cells and plays a key role in immunosuppression.

      Although the exact mechanisms through which imifoplatin exerts its effect have
      yet to be fully elucidated, this agent, upon intravenous administration, binds
      to certain transmembrane proteins and activates several genes involved in tumor
      suppression and apoptosis. This leads to the activation of various signal transduction
      pathways, induces S/G2 phase cell cycle, and causes tumor cell apoptosis. In
      addition, imifoplatin may inhibit angiogenesis. Unlike conventional Pt-based
      chemotherapeutics, imifoplatin does not bind to DNA and is able to overcome
      drug resistance, which occurs with conventional Pt-based chemotherapeutics;
      it also has a more favorable side effect profile and is more stable in plasma.

      are equally affected. UV damage and ingestion of inorganic arsenic may play
      a role in the development of the disease. On the skin surface, it presents as
      a single or multiple erythematous, scaly, keratotic patches or plaques. The
      clinical entity of erythroplasia of Queyrat is regarded as Bowen disease of
      the penis and it presents as an asymptomatic, red, circumscribed plaque. Morphologically,
      Bowen disease is characterized by the presence of hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis,
      dyskeratosis, and acanthosis. The keratotic squamous cells are atypical and
      display hyperchromatism and abnormal mitotic figures. The dermoepidermal basement
      membrane is intact. Complete surgical removal of the lesion may be curative.

      hnCD16 Fc receptor of FT596 binds to the Fc portion of tumor cell-bound monoclonal
      antibodies, leading to NK cell activation, cytokine secretion and enhanced antibody-dependent
      cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). CD19 antigen is a B-cell specific cell surface
      antigen expressed in all B-cell lineage malignancies. CD16, also known as Fc-gamma
      receptor III, is normally expressed on the surface of NK cells, neutrophils,
      monocytes and macrophages, and plays a key role in initiating ADCC. It is often
      downregulated in certain cancers, thereby inhibiting the anti-tumor immune response.

ivaltinostat:
  common:
    description: >-
      A histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Ivaltinosta tinhibits the catalytic activity of HDAC, resulting in an accumulation
      of highly acetylated chromatin histones, followed by the induction of chromatin
      remodeling and an altered pattern of gene expression. In particular, this agent
      enhances the histone acetylation of the tumor suppressor gene p53. This results
      in an accumulation of p53, p53-dependent transactivation and apoptosis in tumor
      cells. HDAC, an enzyme upregulated in many tumor types, deacetylates chromatin
      histone proteins.

ivuxolimab:
  common:

      An agonistic antibody that recognizes the co-stimulatory receptor OX40 (CD134;
      TNFRSF4), with potential immunostimulatory activity. Upon administration, ivuxolimab
      selectively binds to and activates OX40; which induces proliferation of memory
      and effector T-lymphocytes. In the presence of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs),
      this may promote a T-cell-mediated immune response against TAA-expressing tumor
      cells. OX40, a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the tumor necrosis factor
      receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), is expressed on T-lymphocytes and plays an essential
      role in T-cell activation.

kanitinib:
  common:
    description: >-
      A tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the oncoprotein c-Met (hepatocyte growth
      factor receptor; HGFR; MET) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
      2 (VEGFR2), with potential anti-angiogenic and antineoplastic activities. Upon
      oral administration, kanitinib targets and binds to c-Met and VEGFR2, thereby
      disrupting c-Met- and VEGFR2-dependent signal transduction pathways. This may
      induce cell death in tumor cells overexpressing c-Met and/or VEGFR2 protein.
      c-Met and VEGFR2 are both overexpressed in many tumor cell types and play key
      roles in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion, metastasis, and tumor
      angiogenesis.

      antineoplastic activity. Upon administration and internalization by LIV-1-positive
      tumor cells, ladiratuzumab vedotin undergoes enzymatic cleavage to release MMAE
      into the cytosol. In turn, MMAE binds to and inhibits tubulin polymerization,
      which may result in G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in LIV-1-expressing
      tumor cells. LIV-1, a member of the zinc transporter family, is expressed in
      several types of solid tumors and plays a key role in tumor cell progression
      and metastasis. The linkage system in ladiratuzumab vedotin is highly stable
      in plasma, resulting in cytotoxic specificity against LIV-1-positive cells.

laprituximab_emtansine:
  common:
    description: >-
      A targeted antibody payload (TAP)-based immunoconjugate consisting of a human
      monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      conjugated, via a nonreducible thioether linker (succinimidyl trans-4-(maleimidylmethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate
      or SMCC), to the cytotoxic agent maytansinoid mertansine (DM1), with potential
      antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous administration, the monoclonal antibody
      moiety of laprituximab emtansine binds to and inhibits EGFR on tumor cell surfaces.
      Inhibition of EGFR prevents EGFR-mediated signaling and may inhibit tumor cell
      proliferation. After internalization, the mertansine moiety binds to tubulin
      and interferes with microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics. This inhibits
      both cell division and the proliferation of cancer cells that express EGFR.
      EGFR, overexpressed by a variety of cancers, plays a key role in tumor cell
      proliferation and survival. Linkage of the antibody and drug, through a nonreducible
      linker, appears to contribute to the improved efficacy and reduced toxicity
      of this antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) compared to similar ADCs constructed with
      reducible linkers.

letolizumab:
  common:
    description: >-
      A dimeric fusion protein composed of the C-terminus of the domain antibody (dAb)
      BMS2h-572-633 targeting the CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154) linked to a modified
      Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), with potential immunomodulatory activity.
      Upon intravenous administration, the peptide moiety of letolizumab specifically
      targets and binds to CD40L expressed on T-lymphocytes. This prevents the binding
      of CD40L to its cognate receptor CD40 expressed on B-lymphocytes, macrophages,
      and dendritic cells (DCs). This prevents T-cell mediated proliferation and differentiation
      of B-cells, and prevents the production of antibodies. By inhibiting both the
      production of anti-glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antibodies by B-cells and GPIIb/IIIa-dependent
      T-cell proliferation, letolizumab may prevent platelet destruction and may increase
      platelet counts in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The direct binding
      of letolizumab to CD40L on platelets further prevents CD40L/CD40-mediated destruction
      by macrophages and DCs in ITP. The modified Fc domain prevents the binding of
      letolizumab to the Fc receptor FcgammaRIIA on platelets, thereby preventing
      FcgammaRIIA-dependent platelet activation and anti-CD40L-induced thromboembolism.
      CD40L, a transmembrane protein of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily,
      is primarily expressed on activated T-cells, but is also expressed on eosinophils,
      basophils, natural killer (NK) cells, mast cells, platelets and activated endothelial

    description: >-
      A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is

      south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over
      the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and
      even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females
      and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.
      Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present
      as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically,
      there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated
      to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize
      to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver
      cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular
      carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of
      tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

lmp7_inhibitor_m3258:
  common:
    description: >-
      An orally bioavailable, potent, selective, reversible inhibitor of the large
      multifunctional peptidase 7 (LMP7, Beta5i, PSMB8), a chymotrypsin-like, proteolytic
      subunit of the immunoproteasome, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon
      oral administration, LMP7 inhibitor M3258 targets and inhibits the proteolytic
      activity of the LMP7 subunit of immunoproteasome, thereby blocking its deubiquitylating
      activity. This blocks the ubiquitin proteasome degradation pathway, prevents
      the degradation of defective proteins, and leads to an accumulation of poly-ubiquitylated
      proteins. This induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) and results in both
      the induction of tumor cell apoptosis and the inhibition of tumor cell growth.
      Proteasomes are large multi-subunit protease complexes that degrade unneeded
      or damaged proteins that have been ubiquitinated, thereby restoring protein
      homeostasis. Unlike the constitutive proteasome, which is expressed in most
      tissues, immunoproteasome is specifically present in normal and malignant hematopoietic
      cells, including multiple myeloma. Immunoproteasome degrades ubiquitinated proteins,
      generates peptides for presentation on MHC class I, and plays a key role in
      the adaptive immune response and inflammatory diseases.

lodapolimab:

    description: >-
      A monoclonal antibody directed against programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)
      with immune checkpoint inhibitory and potential antineoplastic activities. Upon
      administration, lodapolimab binds to PD-L1 and prevents the interaction of PD-L1
      with its receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). This inhibits the
      activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways, which may enhance
      the T-cell-mediated immune response to neoplasms and reverse T-cell inactivation.
      PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1
      on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. PD-1,
      a transmembrane protein expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator
      of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T-cells.

lowgrade_fibromyxoid_sarcoma:
  common:
    description: >-
      A low grade, late-metastasizing variant of fibrosarcoma characterized by alternating
      fibrous and myxoid areas and a whorling growth pattern.  The neoplastic cells
      have a spindle morphology, and lack hyperchromasia or significant nuclear atypia.  Approximately
      40% of cases show the focal presence of collagen rosettes.  A t(7;16)(q33;p11)
      translocation has been identified in the majority of cases, associated with
      the presence of FUS-CREB3L2 fusion protein.  Rare cases carry the t(11;16)(p11;p11)
      translocation which is associated with the presence of the FUS-CREB3L1 fusion
      protein.

  common:
    description: >-
      An antagonist of the lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5, with potential
      antineoplastic and immunomodulating activities. Upon administration, LRP5 antagonist
      BI 905681 targets and binds to LRP5, thereby blocking the binding of Wnt ligands
      to LRP5. This prevents the formation of the serpentine receptor Frizzled (FZD)-Wnt-LRP5
      trimeric complex and prevents the inactivation of the beta-catenin degradation
      complex, which leads to beta-catenin degradation. This inhibits the Wnt/beta-catenin
      signaling pathway, prevents the beta-catenin-mediated activation of Wnt target
      genes, and inhibits the proliferation and survival of Wnt/beta-catenin-driven
      tumor cells. In addition, inhibition of Wnt signaling by BI 905681 prevents
      Wnt-mediated immune escape, thereby re-activating the immune system, specifically
      inducing the activation of dendritic cells (DCs) and activation as well as infiltration
      of cytotoxic T-cells into the tumor tissue. The FZD-Wnt-LRP5 trimeric complex
      induces phosphorylation of LRP5 intracellular domain leading to inactivation
      of the beta-catenin degradation complex, allowing beta-catenin accumulation;
      stabilized beta-catenin enters the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional activator
      of Wnt target genes. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling plays a key role in tumor cell
      proliferation and survival, and resistance to immunotherapy.

lsd1_inhibitor_syha1807:
  common:
    description: >-
      An orally available inhibitor of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1; KDM1A),
      with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, LSD1 inhibitor
      SYHA1807 targets, binds to and inhibits LSD1, a demethylase that suppresses
      the expression of target genes by converting the di- and mono-methylated forms
      of lysine at position 4 of histone 3 (H3K4) to mono- and unmethylated H3K4,
      respectively. LSD1 inhibition enhances H3K4 methylation and increases the expression
      of tumor suppressor genes. This may lead to an inhibition of cell growth in
      LSD1-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, LSD1 demethylates mono- or di-methylated
      H3K9 which increases gene expression of tumor promoting genes; inhibition of
      LSD1 promotes H3K9 methylation and decreases transcription of these genes. LSD1
      is overexpressed in a number of tumor cell types. LSD1 acts on histone H3 as
      a transcription co-repressor through demethylation of lysine 4 (H3K4) or as
      a transcription co-activator through demethylation of lysine 9 (H3K9).

      to the extracellular domain of HER3 and inhibits HER3 dimerization; thereby,
      preventing EGFR-dependent signaling. In addition, RO5479599 stimulates the immune
      system to exert antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This may decrease
      proliferation of HER3-overexpressing tumor cells. HER3, a member of the epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is frequently
      overexpressed in tumors; it has no active kinase domain but is activated through
      heterodimerization with other members of the EGFR receptor family, such as HER2.

      An agonist of macrocycle-bridged stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein,

      to STING and activates the STING pathway, which promotes IKK-related kinase
      TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) signaling and activates nuclear factor-kappa B
      (NF-kB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) in immune cells in the tumor
      microenvironment (TME). This leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
      including interferons (IFNs). Specifically, expression of IFN-beta (IFNb) enhances
      the cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) by CD8alpha-positive
      and CD103-positive dendritic cells (DCs) to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs).
      This results in a CTL-mediated immune response against tumor cells and causes
      tumor cell lysis. Compared to conventional STING agonists, MBSA E7766 allows
      for conformational rigidity of the unique macrocycle bridge which enhances its
      stability and STING affinity, thereby increasing its efficacy.

      A humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the human cell surface antigen CD47,

      magrolimab selectively binds to CD47 expressed on tumor cells and blocks the
      interaction of CD47 with its ligand signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPa),
      a protein expressed on phagocytic cells. This prevents CD47/SIRPa-mediated signaling,
      allows the activation of macrophages, through the induction of pro-phagocytic
      signaling mediated by calreticulin, which is specifically expressed on the surface
      of tumor cells, and results in specific tumor cell phagocytosis. In addition,
      blocking CD47 signaling activates an anti-tumor T-lymphocyte immune response
      and T-mediated cell killing. CD47, a tumor associated antigen expressed on normal,
      healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), is overexpressed on the surface of a
      variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and interaction with SIRP-alpha,
      leads to inhibition of macrophages and protects cancer cells from phagocytosis
      thereby allowing cancer cells to proliferate.

      in the U.S. and 22% worldwide.  Most patients have widespread disease at diagnosis.  Morphologically,
      follicular lymphomas are classified as Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3, depending
      on the percentage of the large lymphocytes present.  The vast majority of cases
      (70-95%) express the BCL-2 rearrangement [t(14;18)].  Histological grade correlates
      with prognosis.  Grades 1 and 2 follicular lymphomas are indolent and grade
      3 is more aggressive (adapted from WHO, 2001).

      An aggressive, predominantly extranodal, mature T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
      It is characterized by an often angiocentric and angiodestructive cellular infiltrate
      composed of EBV positive NK/T cells. The nasal cavity is the most common site
      of involvement. Patients often present with midfacial destructive lesions (lethal
      midline granuloma). The disease may disseminate rapidly to various anatomic
      sites including the gastrointestinal tract, skin, testis, and cervical lymph
      nodes. It is also known as angiocentric T-cell lymphoma. The term "polymorphic
      reticulosis" has been widely used to describe the morphologic changes seen in
      this type of lymphoma. However, the latter term may also apply to lymphomatoid
      granulomatosis, which is an angiocentric and angiodestructive EBV positive B-cell
      lymphoproliferative disorder.

      manelimab specifically targets and binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and
      activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1). This reverses T-cell inactivation
      caused by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated
      anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-L1 is overexpressed
      by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses
      the immune system and results in immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein
      belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on activated T-cells,
      is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival
      of CD8-positive T-cells.

      cell leukemia-1; Mcl-1; Bcl2-L-3), with potential pro-apoptotic and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon administration, MCL-1 inhibitor ABBV-467 targets and binds
      to Mcl-1, thereby preventing the binding of Mcl-1 to and inactivation of certain
      pro-apoptotic proteins. This promotes apoptosis of cells overexpressing Mcl-1.
      Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein belonging to the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)
      family of proteins, is upregulated in cancer cells and promotes tumor cell survival.

      An inhibitor of MDM2 (murine double minute 2), with potential antineoplastic
      activity. Upon administration, MDM2 inhibitor AMGMDS3 binds to the MDM2 protein
      and prevents its binding to the transcriptional activation domain of the tumor
      suppressor protein p53. By preventing this MDM2-p53 interaction, the transcriptional
      activity of p53 is restored. This leads to p53-mediated induction of tumor cell
      apoptosis. MDM2, a zinc finger protein and a negative regulator of the p53 pathway,
      is overexpressed in cancer cells; it plays a key role in cancer cell proliferation
      and survival.

      An orally bioavailable protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitor of the menin-mixed
      lineage leukemia (MLL; myeloid/lymphoid leukemia; KMT2A) proteins, with potential
      antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, menin-MLL interaction inhibitor
      SNDX-5613 targets and binds to the nuclear protein menin, thereby preventing
      the interaction between the two proteins menin and MLL and the formation of
      the menin-MLL complex. This reduces the expression of downstream target genes
      and results in an inhibition of the proliferation of MLL-rearranged leukemic
      cells. The menin-MLL complex plays a key role in the survival, growth, transformation
      and proliferation of certain kinds of leukemia cells.

      bispecific antibody REGN5093 targets and binds to two different, non-overlapping
      epitopes on MET expressed on the tumor cell surface, thereby forming unique

      unique complex formation causes MET internalization and degradation. This prevents
      MET-mediated signaling and inhibits growth of MET-driven tumor cells. MET, a
      receptor tyrosine kinase, is overexpressed on the cell surfaces of various solid
      tumor cell types where it is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition;

      A representative example is the adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett esophagus.
      This term is also used to describe carcinomas in which the malignant epithelial
      cells show differentiation towards another cell type. A representative example
      of the latter is the metaplastic breast carcinoma in which the malignant glandular
      cells show squamous, spindle cell, or chondroid/osseous differentiation.

metarrestin:
  common:
    description: >-
      An orally available small molecule inhibitor of perinucleolar compartment (PNC),
      with potential antineoplastic activities. Although the exact mechanisms(s) through
      which this agent exerts its effects have yet to be fully elucidated, upon oral
      administration, metarrestin disrupts the structure of PNC and inhibits RNA polymerase
      (Pol) I transcription. This leads to the reduction in the prevalence of PNC
      in cancer cells and decrease in tumor growth and spread. PNC is a subnuclear
      structure and a phenotypic marker of metastatic cancer cells. A high PNC prevalence
      has been associated with disease progression and poor patient outcomes.

      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, modakafusp alfa specifically
      targets and binds to CD38 on CD38-positive tumor cells. In turn, the IFNa moiety
      binds to cell-surface IFN receptors, and activates IFN-mediated signal transduction
      pathways, which results in the transcription and translation of genes whose
      products may cause antiproliferative effects in CD38-positive tumor cells. CD38,
      a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, is present on various immune cells and
      hematologic malignancies, and its expression has been correlated with poor prognosis.

      The muscadine grape extract (MGE) contains numerous phytochemicals including
      hydrolyzable tannins and flavonoids, such as resveratrol, anthocyanin 3,5-diglucosides,
      quercetin, ellagic acid, myricetin, and kaempferol glycosides. Upon administration,
      the active components in the MGE scavenge free radicals, protect against oxidation
      of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and inhibit cell damage due to reactive oxygen
      species (ROS). This inhibits oxidative stress and protects against DNA damage.
      MGE also inhibits enzymes involved in inflammation, cell replication and DNA
      synthesis, and induces the expression of anti-oxidant enzymes. The active ingredients
      may also inhibit certain signaling pathways upregulated in some tumor cell types,
      eventually leading to apoptosis and a reduction in tumor cell proliferation.
      MGE may also boost energy and prevent fatigue.

      A recombinant form of a human macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP1-alpha)

      after local tumor irradiation enhances the anti-tumor effect of ionizing radiation
      at the irradiated site as well as the antitumor effect at non-irradiated tumor
      sites (known as the abscopal effect). The abscopal effect appears to be attributed
      to this agent's ability to recruit and activate leukocytes, such as monocytes,
      dendritic cells, natural killer cells and T lymphocytes, thereby initiating
      an anti-tumor immune response against cancer cells. MIP1-alpha, also known as
      chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3, is a ligand for the chemokine receptors CCR1,
      CCR4 and CCR5 that are involved in immune and inflammatory responses.

      thioether-based linker SMCC to the maytansinoid DM1, with potential pro-apoptotic
      and cytotoxic activities. Upon administration of naratuximab emtansine, the
      antibody moiety of IMGN529 binds to CD37 on tumor B-cells and induces an antibody-dependent
      cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC),
      thereby showing pro-apoptotic activity. In addition, after the internalization
      of this agent and lysosomal degradation, the DM1 moiety binds to tubulin and
      inhibits tubulin polymerization and microtubule assembly, resulting in a disruption
      of microtubule activity and cell division, and eventually causing cell death
      in CD37-positive B-cells. CD37, a transmembrane glycoprotein, is overexpressed
      in B-cell malignancies. Compared to reducible, cleavable linkers, the non-reducible
      SMCC linker shows increased stability in plasma.

      A bispecific monoclonal antibody directed against both the Notch ligand delta-like
      4 (DLL4) and the human tyrosine kinase vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      with potential anti-angiogenic and antineoplastic activities. The anti-DLL4
      moiety of navicixizumab specifically binds to DLL4, prevents its interaction
      with Notch receptors, and inhibits Notch-mediated signaling and gene transcription,
      which may both block tumor angiogenesis and inhibit tumor cell growth. The anti-VEGF
      moiety binds to VEGF and prevents the binding of VEGF to its receptor, which
      blocks VEGF-mediated signaling and further inhibits the growth and maintenance
      of tumor blood vessels. The expression of DLL4 is highly restricted to the vascular
      endothelium; DLL4/Notch signaling is required for the development of functional
      tumor blood vessels. The expression of the pro-angiogenic growth factor VEGF
      is associated with tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation and invasion.

      of involvement. Patients often present with midfacial destructive lesions (lethal
      midline granuloma). The disease may disseminate rapidly to various anatomic
      sites including the gastrointestinal tract, skin, testis, and cervical lymph
      nodes. It is also known as angiocentric T-cell lymphoma. The term "polymorphic
      reticulosis" has been widely used to describe the morphologic changes seen in
      this type of lymphoma. However, the latter term may also apply to lymphomatoid
      granulomatosis, which is an angiocentric and angiodestructive EBV positive B-cell

  common:

      A fusion protein complex composed of a mutated form of the cytokine interleukin
      (IL)-15 (IL-15N72D) and a soluble, dimeric IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ra) Fc
      fusion protein (IL-15Ra-Fc) (IL-15N72D/IL-15Ra-Fc), with potential antineoplastic
      activity. Upon administration, superagonist interleukin-15:interleukin-15 receptor
      alphaSu/Fc fusion complex N-803 binds to the IL-2/IL-15 receptor beta-common
      gamma chain (IL-2Rbetagamma) receptor on natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T lymphocytes,
      which activates and increases the levels of NK cells and memory CD8+(CD44high)
      T-cells. The memory T-cells enhance the secretion of the cytokine interferon-gamma
      (IFN-g), which further potentiates the immune response against tumor cells.
      This may increase tumor cell killing and decrease tumor cell proliferation.
      IL-15 regulates CD8+ T and NK cell development, activation and proliferation.
      By coupling IL-15 to IL15Ra-Fc, this agent has a prolonged drug half-life and
      shows an increased ability to bind IL-2Rbetagamma, which enhances its immune
      stimulatory activity as compared to IL-15 alone.

      inhibits the breakdown of arginine by arginase, which is produced by myeloid
      cells, and restores arginine levels. This allows arginine to stimulate the synthesis
      of nitric oxide and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines,
      which induces the proliferation and activation of T-cells. Therefore, this agent
      may prevent the immunosuppressive effects of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells
      and promote lymphocyte-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. Arginase
      is produced by neutrophils, macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells

oligofucoidan:

    description: >-
      A sulfated polysaccharide low-molecular-weight fucoidan, with potential antioxidant,

      Upon administration of oligo-fucoidan, this agent seems to exert numerous effects
      through various mechanisms of action, some of which remain to be fully elucidated.
      Oligo-fucoidan induces cell cycle arrest, activates caspases, induces apoptosis,
      and inhibits tumor cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. It also increases
      the expression of tumor suppressors, such as p53, while decreasing levels of
      certain tumor promoters. Oligo-fucoidan also promotes the degradation of transforming
      growth factor-beta (TGFb) receptor and the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT). It prevents tumor progression, alters tumor microenvironment
      (TME) and decreases the tumor-promoting M2 macrophages in the TME. Oligo-fucoidan
      has anti-inflammatory effects that suppress the expression of nitric oxide synthase
      (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2),
      and decrease the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1beta
      (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (TNFa). This agent may also suppress
      angiogenic activity by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      receptor expression and VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation. As an antioxidant,
      this agent protects cells against oxidative stress by scavenging superoxide
      radicals and induces the expression of the anti-oxidant nuclear factor erythroid-2-related
      factor 2 and that of its target gene, superoxide dismutase; and prevents reactive
      oxidative species (ROS) generation in cancer cells and ROS release into the
      TME. Fucoidan also has immune-modulatory effects and enhances the proliferation
      of natural killer (NKs) cells and cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs).

      oncolytic vaccinia virus GL-ONC1 specifically enters tumor cells due to the
      permeable nature of the tumor vasculature. Once inside the cell, the virus replicates,
      resulting in tumor cell lysis and the release of mature viral particles into

      neighboring tumor cells. In addition, the release of tumor-associated antigens
      (TAAs) by lysed tumor cells into the bloodstream may activate the immune system
      to mount a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against the tumor. The expression
      of RUC-GFP by this agent allows for both detection and monitoring of virally
      infected tumor cells in vivo and vitro with luciferase-mediated bioluminescence
      imaging and fluorescence imaging techniques.

oncolytic_adenovirus_orca010:
  common:
    description: >-
      A replication competent, oncolytic adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) that has been
      modified with a delta24 (d24) deletion, an incorporation of an RGD-4C motif
      in the Ad fiber protein, and an insertion of the T1 mutation in E3/19K gene,
      with potential oncolytic activity. Upon administration, oncolytic adenovirus
      ORCA-010 binds to specific Ad3 receptors that are highly expressed on certain
      tumor cells. This results in the replication of oncolytic adenovirus Ad5/3-delta24
      in tumor cells and induces tumor cell lysis which may potentially result in
      the activation of a systemic immune response against tumor-associated antigens
      (TAAs). The Ad5/3-delta24 has a 24 base pair deletion in constant region 2 of
      the E1A gene which allows for selective replication in cells that are defective
      in the retinoblastoma gene (Rb) or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A (CDKN2A
      or p16INK4a). As most tumor cells are defective in the Rb/p16 pathway, this
      virus selectively replicates in these cells. The RGD-4C motif is a 9-amino acid
      peptide that binds to various and enhances viral-cell receptor binding by allowing
      for a Coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR)-independent infection of tumor cells,
      which is the natural route of viral binding, as CAR expression is often deficient
      on cancer cells. As integrins are often overexpressed on tumor cell surfaces,
      integrin receptor binding enhances tumor cells binding and infection by the
      Ad. The T1 mutation enhances the Ad5 release from tumor cells and promotes spreading
      throughout the tumor, thereby enhancing anti-tumor activity. The T1 mutation,
      a single Adenine insertion at position 445 of the nucleotide sequence of the
      E3/19K gene of Adenovirus, creates a truncated E3/19K protein that is relocated
      to the plasma membrane due to the disruption of its ER retention signal. This
      increases plasma membrane permeability and enhances the release of Ad5.

    description: >-
      A recombinant, genetically modified, microRNA (miRNA)-attenuated oncolytic viral
      strain of the herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) virus, with potential oncolytic,
      immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. In ONCR-177, a dual bidirectional
      promoter enables the expression of five different transgenes: the natural killer
      (NK) cell and T-cell activating cytokine interleuin-12 (IL-12), the chemokines
      C-C motif chemokine 4 (CCL4) and the extracellular domain of the Fms-related
      tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3LG), to allow for expansion and recruitment of
      classical dendritic cells (DCs), and antagonists to the immune checkpoints programmed
      cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4
      (CTLA-4) to counter T cell exhaustion. Upon intra-tumoral administration, the
      oncolytic HSV-1 ONCR-177 specifically targets, infects and selectively replicates
      in tumor cells only while not infecting normal, healthy cells. This induces
      tumor cell lysis. The released virus particles then infect and replicate in
      neighboring tumor cells, thereby further killing tumor cells. The released tumor-associated
      antigens (TAAs) from the tumor cells activate the immune system to exert an
      anti-tumor immune response against the tumor cells, thereby further killing
      the tumor cells. In addition, the expressed transgenes that are released upon
      tumor cell lysis induce a systemic tumor-specific immune response and activate
      NKs, DCs and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) while inhibiting regulatory T-cells
      (Tregs). This further kills nearby non-infected tumor cells. In ONCR-177, the
      neurovirulence gene ICP34.5 allows for potent oncolysis, even in the presence
      of host cell antiviral responses. To ensure selective replication and oncolysis
      in cancer cells while attenuating replication in healthy tissue, tissue specific
      miRNA-binding cassettes (miR-T) are inserted into early genes essential for
      viral replication. In addition, UL37 mutation suppresses latent infection.

oncolytic_hsv1_expressing_il12_and_antipd1_antibody_t3011:

    description: >-
      A genetically engineered oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 (oHSV-1) expressing
      the human immunostimulating cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) and an antibody
      directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor programmed
      cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279), with potential immune checkpoint
      inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon intratumoral administration,
      oHSV-1 expressing IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody T3011 infects and replicates
      in tumor cells causing viral-mediated tumor cell lysis. The released virus particles,
      in turn, infect and replicate in neighboring tumor cells. Tumor antigens released
      from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific
      systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby
      non-infected tumor cells. In addition, oHSV-1 expressing IL-12 and anti-PD-1
      antibody T3011 promotes the secretion of IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody by the
      tumor cells. IL-12 promotes the activation of natural killer cells, which induces
      both the secretion of interferon-gamma and a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response
      against the tumor cells. This results in both immune-mediated tumor cell death

      binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore
      immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune

      negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated
      by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays
      an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.

ontorpacept:

      CD47 binding domain of human signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPa) linked
      to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), with potential immune checkpoint
      inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, ontorpacept selectively
      targets and binds to CD47 expressed on tumor cells and blocks the interaction
      of CD47 with endogenous SIRPa, a cell surface protein expressed on macrophages.
      This prevents CD47/SIRPa-mediated signaling and abrogates the CD47/SIRPa-mediated
      inhibition of macrophage activation and phagocytosis of cancer cells. This induces
      pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which
      is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL) receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), expressed on macrophages, and results
      in macrophage activation and the specific phagocytosis of tumor cells. CD47,
      also called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen
      (TAA) expressed on normal, healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and overexpressed
      on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction
      with SIRPa, leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects cancer
      cells from phagocytosis, thereby allowing cancer cells to proliferate.

pacmilimab:

      A recombinant antibody prodrug composed of a monoclonal antibody directed against
      the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1;
      B7-H1; CD274) that is linked to a proprietary masking peptide through a protease-cleavable
      linker on the amino terminus of the light chain domain of the antibody, with
      potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration
      of pacmilimab, the linkage system is stable in the circulation and, upon extravasation
      into the tumor microenvironment, the peptide mask is cleaved by tumor-associated
      proteases. These proteases are present in high concentrations and aberrantly
      activated in the tumor microenvironment, while expressed as inactive forms,
      at much lower concentrations, in normal, healthy tissue. Protease cleavage of
      the linker enables binding of the unmasked, fully active monoclonal antibody
      moiety of CX-072 to PD-L1, which is over expressed on certain cancer cells.
      This blocks the binding to and activation of its receptor programmed cell death
      1 (PD-1) on T-lymphocytes, thereby enhancing the T-cell-mediated anti-tumor
      immune response and reversing PD-L1/PD-1-mediated T-cell suppression. PD-L1
      binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune
      evasion. Compared to the unmodified PD-L1 antibody, peptide masking of CX-072
      minimizes binding to PD-L1 in normal tissues, thereby decreasing autoimmune-based
      side effects while retaining anti-tumor activity.

pankras_inhibitor_bi_1701963:

    description: >-
      An orally available protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitor that targets
      the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Son of sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1), with
      potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, pan-KRAS inhibitor
      BI 1701963 selectively targets and binds to SOS1, thereby preventing the interaction
      of SOS1 with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) in the guanosine
      diphosphate (GDP)-bound 'off' state, which is the inactivated state of KRAS.
      This abrogates the exchange of RAS-bound GDP for guanosine triphosphate (GTP)
      and prevents the formation of GTP-loaded KRAS, which is the activated 'on' state
      of KRAS. This prevents activation of downstream RAF/mitogen-activated protein
      kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway
      by GTP-loaded KRAS. This inhibits mutant KRAS-dependent signaling and may inhibit
      growth and survival of KRAS-expressing tumor cells. KRAS is a member of the
      RAS family of oncogenes that is mutated in many cancer cell types. Mutations
      of KRAS may induce constitutive signal transduction leading to tumor cell proliferation,
      survival, invasion, and metastasis. SOS1 regulates the KRAS GDP-GTP cycle and
      promotes nucleotide exchange and formation of 'active' KRAS-GTP.

panmutationselective_egfr_inhibitor_cln081:

    description: >-
      An orally available selective inhibitor of a broad spectrum of epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, including EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations
      (EGFR Ex20ins; Ex20ins mutations), with potential antineoplastic activity. CLN-081
      is also active against other EGFR mutations including exon 19 deletions (exon19del),
      L858R, and T790M, as well as the less common G719X, L861Q and S768I mutations.
      Upon administration, the pan-mutation-selective EGFR inhibitor CLN-081 specifically
      and covalently binds to and inhibits a variety of EGFR mutations, with particularly
      high selectivity against EGFR Ex20ins, which prevents EGFR mutant-mediated signaling
      and leads to cell death in EGFR mutant-expressing tumor cells. Compared to some
      other EGFR inhibitors, CLN-081 may have therapeutic benefits in tumors with
      EGFR Ex20ins, as most EGFR mutant-selective inhibitors are not active against
      EGFR Ex20ins. This agent shows minimal activity against wild-type EGFR (wt EGFR),
      and does not cause dose-limiting toxicities that occur during the use of non-selective
      EGFR inhibitors, which also inhibit wt EGFR. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase
      mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation
      and tumor vascularization.

pantrk_inhibitor_nov1601:
  common:
    description: >-
      An orally bioavailable, selective pan-tropomyosin-related-kinase (tyrosine receptor
      kinase; TRK) inhibitor, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration,
      pan-TRK inhibitor NOV1601 specifically targets and binds to TRK, TRK mutations
      and fusion proteins containing sequences from neurotrophic tyrosine receptor
      kinase (NTRK) types 1 (NTRK1; TrkA), 2 (NTRK2; TrkB), and 3 (NTRK3; TrkC). This
      inhibits neurotrophin-TRK interaction and TRK activation, thereby preventing
      the activation of downstream signaling pathways and resulting in both the induction
      of cellular apoptosis and the inhibition of cell growth in tumors that overexpress
      TRK and/or express NTRK fusion proteins. TRK, a family of receptor tyrosine
      kinases (RTKs) activated by neurotrophins, is encoded by NTRK family genes.
      The expression of either mutated forms of, or fusion proteins involving, NTRK
      family members results in uncontrolled TRK signaling, which plays an important
      role in tumor cell growth, survival, invasion and treatment resistance.

panulisib:

      target of rapamycin (mTOR), activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1) and DNA-dependent
      protein kinase (DNA-PK), with potential anti-angiogenic and antineoplastic activities.
      Upon oral administration, panulisib inhibits the activity of all four kinases.
      This prevents PI3K/mTOR and ALK-1-mediated signaling pathways and may lead to
      the inhibition of cancer cell growth in PI3K/mTOR-overexpressing tumor cells
      and angiogenesis in ALK-1-overexpressing endothelial cells. Also, by inhibiting
      DNA-PK, this agent inhibits the ability of tumor cells to repair damaged DNA.
      The PI3K/mTOR pathway is upregulated in a variety of tumors and plays an important
      role in regulating cancer cell proliferation, growth, and survival. ALK-1, a
      member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) type I receptor family,
      is overexpressed on endothelial cells in a variety of tumor types and increases
      endothelial cell proliferation and migration. DNA-PK is activated upon DNA damage

      proliferation and induces cell death in PI3K-delta-overexpressing tumor cells.
      Unlike other isoforms of PI3K, PI3K-delta is expressed primarily in hematopoietic
      disease and cell lineages. The targeted inhibition of PI3K-delta is designed

      An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of patritumab, a monoclonal antibody
      directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor HER3 (ErbB3),linked
      to the topoisomerase I inhibitor DX 8951, a semisynthetic, water-soluble derivative
      of camptothecin, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration
      of patritumab deruxtecan, the patritumab moiety targets and binds to HER3. After
      internalization, DX 8951 inhibits topoisomerase I activity by stabilizing the
      complex between topoisomerase I and DNA and inhibiting religation of DNA breaks,
      thereby inhibiting DNA replication and triggering apoptotic cell death. HER3,
      a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine
      kinases, is frequently overexpressed in tumors.

      A recombinant, trispecific monovalent antibody-based molecule targeting the

      receptor superfamily member 9; TNFRSF9) and human serum albumin (HSA), with
      potential checkpoint inhibitory, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities.
      PD-L1/4-1BB/HSA trispecific fusion protein NM21-1480 consists of three monovalent
      antibody Fvs specific for PD-L1, HSA and 4-1BB fused in a single chain. Upon
      administration, PD-L1/4-1BB/HSA trispecific fusion protein NM21-1480 simultaneously
      targets and binds to a membrane-distal epitope of 4-1BB, which is expressed
      on a variety of leukocyte subsets including activated T-lymphocytes, and PD-L1
      expressed on tumor cells. The simultaneous binding to PD-L1 enables clustering
      of 4-1BB and thereby allows for conditional stimulation of 4-1BB signaling in
      the tumor microenvironment (TME) only upon binding to PD-L1 on tumor cells.
      4-1BB activation results in T-cell stimulation and enhances T-lymphocyte-mediated
      anti-tumor activity. At the same time, NM21-1480 prevents PD-L1 from binding
      to and activating its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279;
      programmed death-1). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific
      T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which
      may lead to a reduction in tumor growth. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on activated
      T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses
      the immune system and results in immune evasion. 4-1BB, a surface glycoprotein
      of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is an inducible costimulatory
      receptor that plays a key role in T-cell proliferation, survival and cytolytic
      activity. HSA fusion prolongs the half-life of NM21-1480. The conditional activation
      of 4-1BB signaling prevents systemic T-cell activation and lowers toxicity.

pegylated_sn38_conjugate_plx038:
  common:
    description: >-
      A pegylated conjugate of SN-38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin), a biologically
      active metabolite of the prodrug irinotecan, with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon administration, the proprietary linker slowly releases SN-38 from the pegylated
      SN-38 conjugate PLX038. SN-38 binds to and inhibits topoisomerase I by stabilizing
      the cleavable complex between topoisomerase I and DNA, resulting in DNA breaks,
      inhibition of DNA replication, and apoptosis. Compared with irinotecan, this
      formulation allows higher accumulation in solid tumors due to its nanoparticle
      size and long half-life.

pelabresib:
  common:
    description: >-
      A small molecule inhibitor of the Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal (BET) family
      of proteins, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, pelabresib
      binds to the acetylated lysine recognition motifs on the bromodomain of BET
      proteins, thereby preventing the interaction between the BET proteins and acetylated
      histone peptides. This disrupts chromatin remodeling and gene expression. Prevention
      of the expression of certain growth-promoting genes may lead to an inhibition
      of tumor cell growth. Characterized by a tandem repeat of two bromodomains at
      the N-terminus, the BET proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT) are transcriptional
      regulators that play an important role during development and cellular growth.

      (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic treatment. This increases
      chemo- and radiotherapy cytotoxicity and leads to enhanced tumor cell death.
      The enhanced ability of tumor cells to repair DSBs plays a major role in the
      resistance of tumor cells to chemo- and radiotherapy; DNA-PK plays a key role
      in the NHEJ pathway and DSB repair.

    description: >-
      A peptide-based, personalized cancer therapeutic vaccine consisting of up to
      8 patient-specific tumor peptides, which are immunogenic and unique to the patient's
      tumor and identified through DNA and RNA sequencing of a patient's tumor cells,
      combined with the immunostimulant polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized
      with polylysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly-ICLC), with potential immunomodulating
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, personalized and adjusted
      neoantigen peptide vaccine PANDA-VAC stimulates the host immune system to mount
      a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against tumor cells expressing the neoantigens,
      leading to tumor cell lysis. The adjuvant poly-ICLC is a ligand for toll-like
      receptor-3 (TLR3) and induces the release of cytokines which may help to boost
      the immune response against the selected neoantigens. The vaccine may be adjusted
      after initial therapy according to sequencing data.

pimitespib:
  common:
    description: >-
      A specific inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) subtypes alpha and beta,
      with potential antineoplastic and chemo/radiosensitizing activities. Upon oral
      administration, pimitespib specifically binds to and inhibits the activity of
      Hsp90 alpha and beta; this results in the proteasomal degradation of oncogenic
      client proteins, which inhibits client protein dependent-signaling, induces
      apoptosis, and inhibits the proliferation of cells overexpressing HSP90alpha/beta.
      Hsp90, a family of molecular chaperone proteins that are upregulated in a variety
      of tumor cells, plays a key role in the conformational maturation, stability,
      and function of "client" proteins within the cell,; many of which are involved
      in signal transduction, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, including kinases,
      cell-cycle regulators, transcription factors and hormone receptors. As TAS-116
      selectively inhibits cytosolic HSP90alpha and beta only and does not inhibit
      HSP90 paralogs, such as endoplasmic reticulum GRP94 or mitochondrial TRAP1,
      this agent may have less off-target toxicity as compared to non-selective HSP90
      inhibitors.

      factor receptor (EGFR), thereby preventing the activation and subsequent dimerization

      tumor cell proliferation.  In addition, the glyco-optimization promotes antibody-dependent
      cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). EGFR, a member of the epidermal growth factor
      family of extracellular protein ligands, may be overexpressed on the cell surfaces

      CD22 receptors and is rapidly internalized, thereby delivering MMAE intracellularly.

      glycoprotein, is expressed on mature B-cells and on most malignant B-cells.

pixatimod:
  common:
    description: >-
      A synthetic heparan sulfate mimetic with potential anti-angiogenic and antineoplastic
      activity. Pixatimod inhibits the cleavage of heparan sulfate from cell surface
      proteoglycan by heparanase and thus inhibits the neovascularization induced
      by interaction between heparan sulfate and other extracellular matrix proteins.
      In this manner, this agent may have the potential to slow the progression of
      growth of solid tumors.

plamotamab:
  common:
    description: >-
      A bispecific, Fc domain-containing, monoclonal antibody with potential antineoplastic
      activity. Plamotamab contains two antigen-recognition sites: one for human CD3,
      a T cell surface antigen, and one for human CD20, a tumor-associated antigen
      (TAA) that is exclusively expressed on B-cells during most stages of B-cell
      development and is often overexpressed in B-cell malignancies. Upon administration,
      plamotamab binds to both T-cells and CD20-expressing B-lineage tumor cells.
      The resulting cross-linkage may trigger a potent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)
      response against the CD20-expressing tumor B-cells. Inclusion of an Fc domain
      on the antibody prolongs the half-life of the bispecific antibody and enhances
      T-cell-mediated tumor cell killing because the agent is able to bind to Fc receptors.

      immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. pNGVL4a-Sig/E7(detox)/HSP70
      DNA vaccine is an antigen-specific DNA cancer vaccine consisting of the coding
      sequences of a signal peptide (pNGVL4a-Sig), a detox form of the human papillomavirus
      type 16 (HPV-16) antigen E7, and the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Upon administration,
      this prime vaccine may generate potent cytotoxic CD8(+) T-cell responses against
      E7-expressing tumor cells, resulting in tumor cell death. HPV16 L2/E6/E7 fusion
      protein TA-CIN vaccine is a recombinant human papillomavirus (HPV), genetically
      engineered fusion protein vaccine in which the three HPV16 viral proteins L2,
      E6 and E7 are fused together in a single tandem fusion protein (TA-CIN; HPV16
      L2\E6\E7). Upon administration, this boost vaccine may stimulate the immune
      system to generate HPV16 E6\E7-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses as well
      as the induction of L2-specific antibodies. In addition, this vaccine may prevent
      infection and the development of other HPV16-associated diseases. L2, a minor

      A long-acting formulation composed of the human cytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15)
      that is conjugated by polymers, with potential immunomodulating and anti-tumor
      activities. Upon administration of polymer-conjugated IL-15 receptor agonist
      NKTR-255, the IL-15 moiety targets and binds to the alpha subunit of the IL-15
      receptor on natural killer (NK) and T-cells, thereby activating the IL-15-mediated
      pathway. This leads to the expansion and activation of natural killer (NK) cells
      and memory CD8+ T-cells, thereby enhancing the anti-tumor activity of NKs and
      long-term memory T-lymphocyte immune responses. This may increase tumor cell
      killing and decrease tumor cell proliferation. In addition, NKTR-255 may, when
      combined with a tumor-directed antibody, enhance the antibody-dependent cell-mediated
      cytotoxicity (ADCC) mechanism. IL-15 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays
      a key role in the regulation of T- and NK cell activation, proliferation and
      promotion of their anti-tumor effects. Compared to IL-15 alone, the polymer
      formulation allows for increased retention at the tumor site and reduced clearance,
      thereby increasing the effect of IL-15.

      acylation of Wnt ligands and inhibits their secretion. This prevents the activation
      of Wnt ligands, interferes with Wnt-mediated signaling, and inhibits cell growth
      in Wnt-driven tumors. PORCN, a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT), is
      required for the palmitoylation of Wnt ligands, and plays a key role in Wnt
      ligand secretion and activity. Wnt signaling is dysregulated in a variety of

    description: >-
      An orally bioavailable, small molecule, selective and competitive antagonist

      targets, binds to and blocks the activity of PPARa, thereby blocking transcription
      of PPARa target genes leading to an intracellular metabolism shift from fatty
      acid oxidation (FAO) to glycolysis in FAO-dependent tumors and reducing the
      production of fatty acids in the tumor microenvironment (TME). As fatty acids
      are essential for tumor cell growth in FAO-dependent tumor cells and are needed
      for the metabolism of suppressive immune cells in the TME, including regulatory
      T-cells (Tregs), reducing the amount of fatty acids leads to a direct killing
      of FAO-dependent tumor cells. It also skews macrophages from the immune suppressive
      M2 phenotype to an effector M1 phenotype and facilitates the cytotoxicity of
      immune effector cells, thereby stimulating an anti-tumor immune response and
      further killing tumor cells. TPST-1120 also restores the natural inhibitor of
      angiogenesis thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING)
      in the TME. PPARa, a ligand-activated nuclear transcription factor and metabolic
      checkpoint, regulates the expression of FAO genes and lipid metabolism. It plays
      a key role in immunosuppression in the TME. FAO is a metabolic pathway essential
      to tumor growth, survival and immunosuppression.

      moiety of CX-2009 to selectively bind to, be internalized by, and deliver DM4
      into CD166-expressing tumor cells. Following internalization, DM4 is released,
      binds to tubulin and disrupts microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics, resulting
      in inhibition of cell division and cell growth of CD166-expressing tumor cells.
      The masking peptide prevents binding of the anti-CD166 antibody to CD166 in

      epidermotropic, dermal, and subcutaneous.  Often, more than one pattern may
      co-exist in a single biopsy specimen, or may be present in different biopsy
      specimens from the same patient.  The lymphocytic infiltrate is composed of
      medium- to large-sized lymphocytes expressing CD56.  Most cases lack both CD4
      and CD8, although CD8 may be present in some cases.  This group of lymphomas

      An orally available small molecule inhibitor of protein arginine methyltransferase
      5 (PRMT5), with potential antiproliferative and antineoplastic activities. Upon

      its function. By inhibiting its methyltransferase activity, levels of both monomethylated
      and dimethylated arginine residues in histones H2A, H3 and H4 are decreased.
      This modulates the expression of genes involved in several cellular processes,
      including cellular proliferation. This may increase the expression of antiproliferative
      genes and/or decrease the expression of genes that promote cell proliferation,
      which may lead to decreased growth of rapidly proliferating cells, including
      cancer cells. PRMT5, a type II methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation
      of both omega-N monomethylarginine (MMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (sDMA)
      on histones and a variety of other protein substrates involved in signal transduction
      and cellular transcription, is overexpressed in several neoplasms. Elevated

      anti-tumor immune responses, thereby inhibiting tumor cell proliferation. PKM2,
      the predominant PK isoform found in tumor cells, is responsible for catalyzing
      the last step of glycolysis. PKM2 plays a critical role in the metabolic changes
      observed in cancer and immune cells and establishes a metabolic advantage for

racemetyrosinemethoxsalenphenytoinsirolimus_sm88:
  common:
    description: >-
      A combination agent containing racemetyrosine, methoxsalen, phenytoin and sirolimus,
      with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of racemetyrosine/methoxsalen/phenytoin/sirolimus
      SM-88, racemetyrosine, being a dysfunctional and modified form of the non-essential
      amino acid tyrosine, is specifically taken up by cancer cells through the transporter
      L-amino acid transferase-1 (LAT1; CD98). As a tyrosine derivative and faulty
      amino acid protein building block, racemetyrosine prevents protein synthesis
      in cancer cells. Specifically, this prevents mucin-1 (MUC1) protein synthesis.
      MUC1 is highly overexpressed by most cancer cells and regulates the increased
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells created from the altered metabolism
      that cancer cells utilize, by upregulating key antioxidant defenses and preventing
      ROS-mediated apoptosis. In the absence of MUC1, ROS levels are increased, leading
      to an increase in oxidative stress, and induction of apoptosis. Also, being
      a protective transmembrane protein, MUC1 is part of the protective layer on
      the outside of cancer cells and plays a key role in shielding the cancer cell
      from the immune system. The loss of MUC1 compromises the cell membrane, thereby
      making the cancer cell more vulnerable to be recognized and attacked by the
      immune system. Rapamycin, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor,
      increases the cancer cells' need for tyrosine uptake and increases the uptake
      of racemetyrosine by LAT1. Phenytoin stimulates the release of reactive lipid
      species by the liver which accumulate in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and
      are taken up by cancer cells, thereby further increasing ROS within the cancer
      cell and increasing oxidative-related apoptosis. Mehoxsalen promotes toxic electron
      transfer and increases melanin, increases oxidative reactions and production
      of ROS. This further stimulates oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. Normal
      cells do not regularly take up certain non-essential amino acids, such as tyrosine,
      but readily convert phenylalanine to tyrosine, so normal healthy cells are not
      expected to consume racemetyrosine.

      antibody, with potential immune checkpoint modulating activity. Ragifilimab
      binds to and activates GITRs found on multiple types of T-cells. This stimulates
      the immune system, induces both the activation and proliferation of tumor-antigen-specific
      T effector cells (Teff), and suppresses the function of activated T regulatory
      cells (Tregs). This leads to tumor cell eradication. GITR, a member of the TNF
      receptor superfamily and T-cell receptor co-stimulator, is expressed on the
      surface of multiple immune cell types, including Tregs, Teffs, B-cells, and
      natural killer (NK) cells. Inappropriately activated Tregs suppress Teffs and
      suppress T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling.

      (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; Apo2L), with potential pro-apoptotic
      and antineoplastic activities. The binding of TRAIL to the Trimer-Tag allows
      TRAIL to form a stable covalently-linked homotrimer. Upon administration of
      recombinant human TRAIL-trimer fusion protein SCB-313, this fusion protein targets,
      binds to and trimerizes the TRAIL-receptors, pro-apoptotic death receptors (DRs)
      TRAIL-R1 (death receptor 4; DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (death receptor 5; DR5), expressed
      on tumor cells, thereby activating caspases and inducing apoptosis in TRAIL-R1/R2-expressing
      tumor cells. TRAIL, a homotrimeric type II transmembrane protein and member
      of the TNF superfamily of cytokines, plays a key role in the induction of apoptosis
      through TRAIL-mediated death receptor pathways. The pro-apoptotic cell surface
      receptors TRAIL-R1 and -R2, members of the TNF receptor family, are overexpressed
      by a variety of cancer cell types; The induction of receptor trimerization is
      needed for the initiation of the apoptotic signaling pathway. The TRAIL-Trimer
      retains similar bioactivity and receptor binding kinetics as native TRAIL but
      has more favorable pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity than native TRAIL.

      recombinant humanized anti-HER-2 bispecific monoclonal antibody MBS301 simultaneously
      targets and binds to two separate, non-overlapping epitopes of HER-2. This prevents
      the activation of HER-2 signaling pathways. Also, by binding to HER-2, MBS301
      induces an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against tumor
      cells that overexpress HER-2. This results in tumor cell apoptosis and inhibits
      tumor cell proliferation of HER-2-overexpressing tumor cells. HER-2, overexpressed

refractory_anemia_with_excess_blasts_in_transformation:
  common:
    description: >-
      Refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) is characterised
      by dysplastic features of the myeloid and usually erythroid progenitor cells
      in the bone marrow and an increased number of myeloblasts in the peripheral
      blood.  The peripheral blood blast count ranges from 20% to 30%.  RAEB-T used
      to be a subcategory of myelodysplastic syndromes in the past.  Recently, the
      term has been eliminated from the WHO based classification of myelodysplastic
      syndromes.  The reason is that the percentage of peripheral blood blasts required
      for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia has been reduced to 20%.  The elimination
      of the RAEB-T term by the WHO experts has created confusion and ongoing arguments.  Currently,
      according to WHO classification, the vast majority of RAEB-T cases are best
      classified as acute leukemias (acute leukemias with multilineage dysplasia following
      myelodysplastic syndrome).  A minority of cases are part of RAEB-2.

      are unilateral; 60% occur sporadically. A predisposition to retinoblastoma has
      been associated with 13q14 cytogenetic abnormalities. Patients with the inherited

retsrc_inhibitor_tpx0046:
  common:
    description: >-
      An orally bioavailable selective dual inhibitor of fusions and mutations involving
      the proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase rearranged during transfection (ret)
      and the src family tyrosine kinases, with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon oral administration, the RET/SRC inhibitor TPX-0046 specifically targets
      and binds to ret mutants and ret-containing fusion products. This results in
      an inhibition of cell growth of tumor cells that exhibit increased ret activity.
      By inhibiting src kinase-mediated signaling and reducing the src-initiated recruitment
      of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases involved in bypass resistance, TPX-0046
      may be able to overcome tumor resistance which may increase its therapeutic
      effect. Ret overexpression, activating mutations, and fusions result in the
      upregulation and/or overactivation of ret tyrosine kinase activity in various
      cancer cell types; dysregulation of ret activity plays a key role in the development
      and progression of these cancers. Src tyrosine kinases are upregulated in many
      tumor cells and play important roles in tumor cell proliferation, survival,
      migration, invasion and angiogenesis. Src upregulation is seen in tumors with
      acquired resistance to RET inhibitors.

      activity. Upon administration, rezivertinib specifically and covalently binds
      to and inhibits selective EGFR mutations, with particularly high selectivity
      against the T790M mutation, which prevents EGFR mutant-mediated signaling and
      leads to cell death in EGFR mutant-expressing tumor cells. Compared to some
      other EGFR inhibitors, BPI-7711 may have therapeutic benefits in tumors with
      T790M-mediated drug resistance. This agent shows minimal activity against wild-type
      EGFR (wt EGFR), and does not cause dose-limiting toxicities that occur during
      the use of non-selective EGFR inhibitors, which also inhibit wt EGFR. EGFR,
      a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role
      in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.

      of ropeginterferon alfa-2b, IFN-a2b targets and binds to specific IFN cell-surface
      receptors. This activates IFN-mediated signal transduction pathways and induces
      the transcription and translation of genes with IFN-specific response elements
      (ISREs). Their protein products mediate antiviral, antiproliferative, anticancer,
      and immune-modulating effects. The PEG moiety inhibits proteolytic breakdown
      and clearance of IFN-a2b, which prolongs its half-life, extends the duration
      of its therapeutic effects and allows less frequent dosing. The proline linker
      facilitates the synthesis of a single positional isomer which further increases
      its stability and half-life.

      S6 kinase (p90RSK; RSK) subtypes 1-4, with high selectivity for RSK subtype
      2 (RSK2), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of the
      RSK1-4 inhibitor PMD-026, this agent targets and inhibits the RSK subtypes,
      thereby inhibiting RSK-mediated signaling. This prevents the phosphorylation
      and activation of the transcription factor Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) and
      leads to cell cycle arrest, an induction of apoptosis, and an inhibition of
      tumor cell proliferation in RSK-expressing tumor cells. RSK is overexpressed
      in a variety of cancers, especially in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).
      It plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, differentiation, survival,
      and metastasis.

      upon administration, BOLD-100 may selectively inhibit stress-induced upregulation
      of GRP78, thereby preventing the activation of multiple GRP78-mediated pathways

      GRP78, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone and unfolded protein response
      (UPR) regulator, is overexpressed on the surface of a variety of cancer cell
      types. Its expression is associated with increased tumor cell survival and proliferation,

      the immune system may induce systemic innate and adaptive immune responses mediated
      by anti-tumor natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and natural
      killer T (NKT) cells. This may trigger an immune response against tumor associated
      antigens on tumors distant from the primary tumor. Human lactoferrin, a 692
      amino acid glycoprotein, belongs to the transferrin family of metal-binding
      proteins.

      An inhibitor of the human inhibitory receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1;

      Upon administration, sasanlimab targets and binds to PD-1 and blocks the interaction
      between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2).
      This prevents the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways.
      This may restore immune function through the activation of natural killer (NK)
      cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) against tumor cells. PD-1, an inhibitory
      receptor belonging to the B7-receptor family, is expressed on activated T-lymphocytes,
      B-cells and NK cells; it functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates
      T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands, and plays
      an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.

      agent and pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer, with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon intravenous administration of serclutamab talirine, the serclutamab moiety
      targets and binds to EGFR on tumor cell surfaces. Following receptor internalization
      and lysosome-mediated cleavage, talirine is released. In turn, the imine groups
      of the PBD moiety bind to the N2 positions of guanines on opposite strands of
      DNA. This induces DNA strand breaks, inhibits DNA replication, leads to G2/M
      cell cycle arrest, induces cell death, and inhibits the proliferation of EGFR-overexpressing
      tumor cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is overexpressed by
      a variety of cancers, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival.

      and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane
      protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions
      as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector
      function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)

      to a 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory, immunostimulating
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, the SIRPa-4-1BBL fusion
      protein DSP107 selectively targets and binds to both CD47 expressed on tumor
      cells and 4-1BB (CD137; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9;
      TNFRSF9) expressed on T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Binding to CD47
      blocks the interaction of CD47 with endogenous SIRPa, a cell surface protein
      expressed on macrophages. This prevents CD47/SIRPa-mediated signaling and abrogates
      the CD47/SIRPa-mediated inhibition of macrophage activation and phagocytosis
      of cancer cells. This induces pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding
      of calreticulin (CRT), which is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor
      cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1),
      which is expressed on macrophages, and results in macrophage activation and
      the specific phagocytosis of tumor cells. The binding of 4-1BBL to 4-1BB activates
      4-1BB-mediated signaling, induces cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) proliferation,
      cytokine production and promotes a CTL-mediated anti-tumor immune response as
      well as NK-mediated tumor cell killing. The crosslinking specifically enables
      the activation of 4-1BB-mediated signaling in T-cells and NK cells in the tumor
      microenvironment (TME), allowing targeted immune responses in the TME. CD47,
      also called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen
      (TAA) expressed on normal, healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and overexpressed
      on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction
      with SIRPa, leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects cancer
      cells from phagocytosis, thereby allowing cancer cells to proliferate. 4-1BB,
      a surface glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is
      an inducible costimulatory receptor that plays a key role in T-cell proliferation,
      survival and cytolytic activity.

      and the specific phagocytosis of tumor cells. The binding of CD40L to CD40 activates
      CD40, increases CD40-mediated signaling and induces proliferation and activation
      of B-lymphocytes, shifts the induction of suppressive macrophages towards immunostimulatory
      macrophages, activates monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs), and leads to
      the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. This activates the immune system to
      induce the proliferation and activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) against
      tumor cells. The crosslinking specifically enhances antigen presentation to
      CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes and tumor cell phagocytosis by the APC. CD47, also
      called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA)
      expressed on normal, healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and overexpressed
      on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction
      with SIRPa, leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects cancer
      cells from phagocytosis, thereby allowing cancer cells to proliferate.

      A humanized monoclonal antibody agonist of the cell surface receptor CD40, with

      CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154), sotigalimab binds to CD40 on a variety of immune
      cell types. This triggers the cellular proliferation and activation of antigen-presenting
      cells (APCs), and activates B-cells, and effector and memory T-cells. This results
      in an enhanced immune response against tumor cells. Sotigalimab also binds to
      and activates CD40 present on the surfaces of some solid tumor cells, leading
      to apoptosis and decreased tumor growth. CD40, a cell surface receptor and member
      of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, is expressed on various
      immune cells and certain cancer cells; it mediates both indirect tumor cell
      killing through the activation of the immune system and direct tumor cell apoptosis.

squamous_odontogenic_tumor:
  common:
    description: >-
      A rare, locally invasive neoplasm arising from tooth-forming tissues. It usually
      grows intraosseously in the mandible. The maxilla is less frequently involved.
      It is characterized by the presence of well differentiated squamous cells which
      form islands. Recurrences may rarely occur and probably are related to incomplete
      excision of the tumor.

srpk1abcg2_inhibitor_sco101:
  common:
    description: >-
      An orally bioavailable inhibitor of the serine/arginine-rich splicing factor
      protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) and the ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2
      (ABCG2), with potential chemosensitizing and antineoplastic activities. Upon
      oral administration, SRPK1/ABCG2 inhibitor SCO-101 targets, binds to and inhibits
      the activity of SRPK1 and ABCG2. Inhibition of the cellular efflux pump ABCG2
      by SCO-101 prevents the efflux of co-administered chemotherapeutic agents from
      cancer cells. This may abrogate cancer cell drug resistance and may re-sensitize
      cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agents. Inhibition of SRPK1 kinase by SCO-101
      inhibits the SRPK1-mediated phosphorylation of splicing factors rich in serine/arginine
      domains, thereby inhibiting the activation of proteins that are involved in
      the regulation of alternative splicing. This may inhibit cancer cell proliferation.
      SRPK1 is upregulated in various cancer cell types. Its upregulation is correlated
      with higher tumor staging, grading, and shorter survival.

      as follows: (T0, N2, M0); (T1, N2, M0); (T2, N2, M0); (T3, N1, M0); (T3, N2,
      M0). T0: No evidence of primary tumor. T1: Tumor 20 mm or less in greatest dimension.
      T1 includes T1mi. T1mi: Tumor 1 mm or less in greatest dimension. T2: Tumor
      more than 20 mm but not more than 50 mm in greatest dimension. T3: Tumor more
      than 50 mm in greatest dimension. N1: Metastasis to movable ipsilateral level
      I, II axillary lymph node(s). N2: Metastases in ipsilateral level I, II axillary
      lymph nodes that are clinically fixed or matted; or in clinically detected ipsilateral
      internal mammary nodes in the absence of clinically evident axillary lymph node
      metastases. M0: No clinical or radiographic evidence of distant metastasis.
      M0 includes M0(i+); for cervical cancer, stage IIIA is defined as follows: T3a,
      N0, M0. T3a: Tumor involves lower third of vagina, no extension to pelvic wall.
      N0: No regional lymph node metastasis. M0: No distant metastasis. (partially

      This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and enhances
      the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response against
      PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell
      types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results
      in immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin
      superfamily expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune
      system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells. Anti-PD-L1
      monoclonal antibody CS1001 mirrors natural immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), potentially
      reducing immunogenicity and other toxicities.

      A malignant neoplasm characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11;q11).  It
      can occur at any age, but mainly affects young adults, more commonly males.  Although
      any site can be affected, the vast majority of the cases arise in the deep soft
      tissues of extremities, especially around the knee.  Microscopically, synovial
      sarcoma is classified as monophasic (with a spindle or epithelial cell component)
      or biphasic (with both spindle and epithelial cell components).  Synovial sarcomas
      can recur or metastasize to the lungs, bones, and lymph nodes.

    description: >-
      A synthetic form of the plant-derived medicinal agent, plumbagin, with potential
      antineoplastic activity.  Plumbagin may act by inhibiting the expression of
      protein kinase C epsilon (PKCe), signal transducers and activators of transcription
      3 phosphorylation (Stat3), protein kinase B (AKT), and certain epithelial-to-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT) markers, including vimentin and slug. This results in possible
      inhibition of proliferation in susceptible tumor cells.  PKCe, Stat3, AKT, and
      the EMT markers vimentin and slug have been linked to the induction and progression
      of prostate cancer.

      of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and destabilization of AXIN, a negative regulator
      of beta-catenin, and prevents Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. This may inhibit the
      activation of transcription of a wide range of target genes of Wnt/beta-catenin
      signaling, thereby preventing gene expression of many Wnt-related, pro-survival
      proteins and suppressing tumor cell growth. Tankyrase, a member of the PARP
      family, plays an important role in the regulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
      pathway, tumor suppressors, as well as telomere maintenance and mitosis regulation.

      antigen, and human B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA; TNFRSF17), a tumor-associated
      antigen (TAA) expressed on plasma cells, with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon administration, teclistamab binds to both CD3 on T-cells and BCMA expressed
      on malignant plasma cells. This results in the cross-linking of T-cells and
      tumor cells, and induces a potent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against
      BCMA-expressing plasma cells. BCMA, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor
      superfamily that is specifically overexpressed on malignant plasma cells, plays
      a key role in promoting plasma cell survival.

      glutaminase, a mitochondrial enzyme that is essential for the conversion of
      the amino acid glutamine into glutamate. By blocking glutamine utilization,
      proliferation in rapidly growing cells is impaired. Glutamine-dependent tumors
      rely on the conversion of exogenous glutamine into glutamate and glutamate metabolites

    description: >-
      The hydrochloride salt form of CB-839, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of glutaminase,

      CB-839 selectively and reversibly binds to and inhibits human glutaminase, an
      enzyme that is essential for the conversion of the amino acid glutamine into
      glutamate. Blocking glutamine metabolism inhibits proliferation in rapidly growing
      tumor cells and leads to an induction of cell death. Unlike normal healthy cells,
      glutamine-dependent tumors heavily rely on the intracellular conversion of exogenous
      glutamine into glutamate and glutamate metabolites to both provide energy and
      generate building blocks for the production of macromolecules, which are needed
      for cellular growth and survival. In addition, CB-839 causes accumulation of
      glutamine in tumor cells and increases glutamine concentration in the tumor
      microenvironment (TME) upon cell death. As glutamine is essential for T-cell
      generation, CB-839 may also enhance T-cell proliferation and activation in the
      TME, which may lead to further killing of tumor cells.

      Upon administration, TGFbR1 inhibitor SH3051 specifically targets and binds
      to TGFbR1, which prevents TGFbR1-mediated signal transduction. This abrogates
      TGFbR1-mediated immunosuppression, enhances anti-tumor immunity in the tumor
      microenvironment (TME) and promotes a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated
      immune response against tumor cells leading to tumor cell death. This may lead
      to a reduction in TGFbR1-dependent proliferation of tumor cells. The TGF-beta
      signaling pathway is often deregulated in tumors and plays a key role in the
      regulation of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, motility, invasion, and
      angiogenesis. It plays a key role in immunosuppression in the TME and cancer

      domain, a toll-like receptor (TLR) peptide agonist as an adjuvant and a chimeric
      cargo, a multiple antigenic domain (MAD; MultiE), that contains an as of yet
      not disclosed amount of major histocompatibility class (MHC)-restricted peptides
      derived from as of yet undisclosed tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) that are
      specific for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, with potential immunomodulating
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of ATP128, the Z12 moiety
      targets, binds to and penetrates antigen-presenting cells (APCs), specifically
      dendritic cells (DCs) and promotes the loading of the epitopes into the DCs
      and transports antigenic cargoes into both endosomal and cytosolic compartments.
      Upon processing and antigen presentation by MHC II and I, the immune system
      is stimulated and activates specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, respectively, against
      the multi-epitopes specific for the CRC cells, thereby killing the CRC cells.

      the immune system. Its function is the maturation of the progenitor lymphoid
      cells to thymocytes and subsequently to mature T-cells. It reaches its greatest

      inhibitory motif (ITIM) domains (TIGIT), a co-inhibitory molecule and immune
      checkpoint inhibitor, with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic
      activities. Upon administration, TIGIT inhibitor M6223 targets and binds to
      TIGIT expressed on various immune cells, particularly on tumor-infiltrating
      T-lymphocytes (TILs), thereby preventing the interaction of TIGIT with its ligands
      CD112 (nectin-2; poliovirus receptor related-2; PRR2; PVRL2) and CD155 (poliovirus
      receptor; PVR; nectin-like protein 5; NECL-5). This enhances the interaction
      of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX Accessory molecule-1;
      DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells
      and CD8+ T-cells. This leads to CD226 dimerization and CD226-mediated signaling
      and activates the immune system to exert a T-cell-mediated immune response against
      cancer cells. TIGIT, a member of the Ig super family (IgSF) and an immune inhibitory
      receptor, plays a key role in the suppression of T-cell proliferation and activation;
      it is involved in tumor cell immune evasion, and the inhibition of antiviral

      composed of EBV positive NK/T cells. The nasal cavity is the most common site
      of involvement. Patients often present with midfacial destructive lesions (lethal
      midline granuloma). The disease may disseminate rapidly to various anatomic
      sites including the gastrointestinal tract, skin, testis, and cervical lymph
      nodes. It is also known as angiocentric T-cell lymphoma. The term "polymorphic
      reticulosis" has been widely used to describe the morphologic changes seen in
      this type of lymphoma. However, the latter term may also apply to lymphomatoid
      granulomatosis, which is an angiocentric and angiodestructive EBV positive B-cell

      An orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant, selective, small molecule inhibitor
      of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), with potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory
      activities. Upon oral administration, tolebrutinib is able to cross the blood-brain
      barrier and inhibits the activity of BTK both peripherally and in the central
      nervous system (CNS). This prevents the activation of the B-cell antigen receptor
      (BCR) signaling pathway, and the resulting immune activation and inflammation.
      The inhibition of BTK activity also prevents microglial inflammatory signaling
      in the CNS, and the resulting immune activation, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.
      BTK, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase and member of the Tec family of kinases,
      plays an important role in B lymphocyte development, activation, signaling,
      proliferation and survival. In addition to B cells, BTK is also expressed in
      innate immune cells, including macrophages and microglia, and plays an important
      role in the regulation of microglial inflammatory signaling.

      event at the DNA level joining a V segment with a J segment. The C segment is
      later joined by splicing at the RNA level. Recombination of many different V
      segments with several J segments provides a wide range of antigen recognition.
      Additional diversity is attained by junctional diversity, resulting from the
      random additional of nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. (from

      derivative), a DNA topoisomerase 1 (topoisomerase I; Top1) inhibitor, with antineoplastic
      activity. Upon administration of trastuzumab deruxtecan, trastuzumab targets
      and binds to HER2 on tumor cells. Upon antibody/antigen binding and internalization,
      deruxtecan binds to and inhibits Top1-DNA complexes, which results in an inhibition
      of DNA replication, cell cycle arrest and tumor cell apoptosis. HER2, a tyrosine
      kinase receptor, is overexpressed by many cancer cell types. In addition, trastuzumab
      deruxtecan induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and
      causes a bystander killing effect.

trastuzumabtlr_78_agonist_bdc1001:

    description: >-
      An immune stimulating antibody conjugate (ISAC) consisting of trastuzumab, an
      anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) monoclonal antibody, conjugated
      to a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 dual agonist, with potential immunostimulating
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of trastuzumab-TLR 7/8 agonist
      BDC-1001, the trastuzumab moiety targets and binds to HER2 expressed on tumor
      cells and, simultaneously, the TLR 7/8 dual agonist moiety targets, binds to
      and activates TLR7/8 expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), specifically
      dendritic cells (DCs), in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The trastuzumab
      binding to the tumor cells causes the engulfment of the BDC-1001-bound tumor
      cells by tumor-associated myeloid (TAM) cells and the TAMs travel to the lymph
      nodes. The DCs activated by the TLR7/8 agonist causes the activation of TLR7/8-mediated
      pathways, and stimulates the maturation and activation of DCs, thereby re-activating
      the immune system against the tumor cells. Activation of DCs results in the
      production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
      (CTL)- and B-lymphocyte-mediated immune responses against tumor-associated antigens
      (TAAs), which lead to tumor cell lysis. TLR7 and 8, members of the TLR family,
      play fundamental roles in the activation of the innate immune system, myeloid
      cell responses and tumor antigen presentation. HER2 is overexpressed by a variety
      of tumor cell types.

      transport protein 2B (SLC34A2; NaPi2b), with potential antineoplastic activity.
      Upon administration of upifitamab, the antibody targets and binds to NaPi2b
      expressed on tumor cells. Although the tumor cell killing effects of XMT-1535
      are not established, this binding may induce an antibody-dependent cellular
      cytotoxicity (ADCC)-mediated immune response against NaPi2b-expressing tumor
      cells, and/or may inhibit NaPi2b-mediated sodium and phosphate ion cotransport
      activity and ion-dependent tumor cell signaling. NaPi2b, a tumor-associated
      antigen (TAA), is overexpressed on a variety of tumor cells. It plays a key
      role in the transport of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and the maintenance of phosphate
      homeostasis.

urabrelimab:
  common:
    description: >-
      A human monoclonal antibody targeting the human cell surface antigen CD47, with
      potential phagocytosis-inducing and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration,
      urabrelimab selectively binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks the interaction
      of CD47 with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha), an inhibitory protein
      expressed on macrophages. This prevents CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated signaling and
      abrogates the CD47/SIRPa-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis. This induces pro-phagocytic
      signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which is specifically
      expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related
      protein (LRP), expressed on macrophages. This results in macrophage activation
      and the specific phagocytosis of tumor cells. In addition, blocking CD47 signaling
      activates both an anti-tumor T-lymphocyte immune response and T cell-mediated
      killing of CD47-expressing tumor cells. CD47, also called integrin-associated
      protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) expressed on normal, healthy
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and overexpressed on the surface of a variety
      of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction with SIRPalpha, leads
      to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects cancer cells from phagocytosis,
      which allows cancer cells to proliferate.

      T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, vibostolimab targets and
      binds to TIGIT expressed on various immune cells, particularly on tumor-infiltrating
      T-lymphocytes (TILs) and natural killer (NK) cells, thereby preventing the interaction
      of TIGIT with its ligands CD112 (nectin-2; poliovirus receptor related-2; PVRL2)
      and CD155 (poliovirus receptor; PVR; nectin-like protein 5; NECL-5), which are
      expressed on T-cells, NK cells and certain cancer cells. This enhances the interaction
      of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX Accessory molecule-1;
      DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune cells, such as NK cells and CD8+ T-cells,
      and activates CD226-mediated signaling. This activates the immune system to
      exert a T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells. TIGIT, a member
      of the Ig super family and an immune inhibitory receptor, is overexpressed on
      tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells and CD8+ TILs and plays a key role in the
      suppression of T-cell proliferation and activation; it is involved in tumor
      cell immune evasion, and the inhibition of antiviral immune responses.

      dehydrogenase [NADP+], mitochondrial) in the mitochondria, with potential antineoplastic
      activity. Upon administration, vorasidenib specifically inhibits mutant forms
      of IDH1 and IDH2, thereby inhibiting the formation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate
      (2HG) from alpha-ketoglutarate (a-KG). This prevents 2HG-mediated signaling
      and leads to both an induction of cellular differentiation and an inhibition
      of cellular proliferation in tumor cells expressing IDH mutations. In addition,
      vorasidenib is able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). IDH1 and 2,
      metabolic enzymes that catalyze the conversion of isocitrate into a-KG, play
      key roles in energy production and are mutated in a variety of cancer cell types.
      In addition, mutant forms of IDH1 and 2 catalyze the formation of 2HG and drive
      cancer growth by blocking cellular differentiation and inducing cellular proliferation.

      as skeletal muscle and bone, where it binds to and activates androgen receptors
      (ARs). In the prostate and breasts, RAD140 acts as an antagonist and blocks
      AR activation and AR-mediated cellular proliferation. Therefore, this agent
      may improve bone formation and muscle mass and strength, and may inhibit both
      the growth of the prostate in males and AR-dependent breast cancer cell proliferation.

      An inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase Wee1 (Wee1-like protein kinase; Wee1A kinase;

      mechanism of action by which this agent inhibits Wee1 has yet to be disclosed,
      upon administration of ZN-c3, this agent targets and inhibits Wee1. Inhibition
      of Wee1 promotes both premature mitosis and a prolonged mitotic arrest leading
      to cell death in susceptible tumor cells, such as p53-deficient or mutated human
      cancers that lack the G1 checkpoint, upon treatment with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic
      agents. Unlike normal cells, most p53-deficient or mutated human cancers lack
      the G1 checkpoint as p53 is the key regulator of the G1 checkpoint and these
      cells rely on the G2 checkpoint for DNA repair to damaged cells. Annulment of
      the G2 checkpoint may therefore make p53-deficient tumor cells more vulnerable
      to antineoplastic agents and enhance their cytotoxic effect. Overexpression
      of Wee1 occurs in several cancer types and high expression of Wee1 is associated
      with poor outcomes. Wee1 phosphorylates Cdc2 in the Cdc2/cyclin B (CDK1/cyclin
      B) complex which blocks progression from G2 into mitosis; it negatively regulates
      the G2 checkpoint by disallowing entry into mitosis in response to DNA damage.

wee1_kinase_inhibitor_debio_0123:
  common:
    description: >-
      An orally bioavailable inhibitor of the human tyrosine kinase Wee1 (Wee1-like
      protein kinase; Wee1A kinase; WEE1hu), with potential antineoplastic sensitizing
      activity. Upon oral administration of Debio 0123, this agent targets, binds
      to and inhibits Wee1. Inhibition of Wee1 inhibits Cdk1 (Cdc2) phosphorylation,
      promotes both premature mitosis and a prolonged mitotic arrest, which results
      in the accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage. This leads to apoptosis in susceptible
      tumor cells, such as p53-deficient or mutated human cancers that lack the G1
      checkpoint, especially in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents.
      Unlike normal cells, most p53-deficient or mutated human cancers lack the G1
      checkpoint as p53 is the key regulator of the G1 checkpoint and these cells
      rely on the G2 checkpoint for DNA repair to damaged cells. Annulment of the
      G2 checkpoint may therefore make p53-deficient tumor cells more vulnerable to
      antineoplastic agents and enhance their cytotoxic effect. Overexpression of
      Wee1 occurs in several cancer types and high expression of Wee1 is associated
      with poor outcomes. Wee1 phosphorylates Cdc2 in the Cdc2/cyclin B (CDK1/cyclin
      B) complex which blocks progression from G2 into mitosis. The Wee1 tyrosine
      kinase is activated upon DNA damage and regulates the G2-M and S cell cycle
      checkpoints.

xevinapant:
  common:
    description: >-
      An orally available mimetic of the natural second mitochondrial-derived activator
      of caspases (Smac) and inhibitor of Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs),
      with potential immunomodulating, apoptotic-inducing, chemo-radio-sensitizing
      and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration,xevinapant targets and
      binds to the Smac binding groove on IAPs, including the direct caspase inhibitor
      X chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP), and the cellular IAPs 1 (c-IAP1) and 2 (c-IAP2).
      This inhibits the activities of these IAPs and promotes the induction of apoptosis.
      Additionally, as xevinapant inhibits the activity of IAPs, it may work synergistically
      with cytotoxic drugs and/or radiation to overcome tumor cell resistance to apoptosis.
      As IAPs regulate nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) signaling pathways, which drives
      the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, xevinapant
      may enhance anti-tumor immune responses when administered with certain immunomodulating
      agents, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. IAPs are overexpressed by many
      cancer cell types and suppress both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis by binding
      to and inhibiting active caspases via their baculoviral lAP repeat (BIR) domains.
      They contribute to chemo-radio-resistance of cancer cells to certain cytotoxic
      agents and radiation, promote tumor cell survival and are associated with poor
      prognosis in certain types of cancer. SMAC, a pro-apoptotic mitochondrial protein,
      is an endogenous inhibitor of the IAPs family of cellular proteins.

      xiliertinib binds to and inhibits the activity of EGFR. This prevents EGFR-mediated
      signaling, and may lead to both induction of cell death and inhibition of tumor
      growth in EGFR-overexpressing cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated

xisomab_3g3:
  common:
    description: >-

      Upon administration, xisomab 3G3 targets and binds to the apple 2 domain of
      FXI, thereby preventing the binding of FXI to factor XIIa (FXIIa). This blocks
      factor XIIa-mediated FXI activation without inhibiting FXI activation by thrombin
      or the procoagulant function of FXIa. The abrogation of FXI activation prolongs
      the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and reduces platelet and fibrin
      accumulation. This results in the inhibition of contact activation-initiated
      blood coagulation and prevents thrombus formation. FXI contributes to thrombotic
      disease while playing a limited role in normal hemostasis. Activation of FXI
      is essential for thrombus growth and stabilization.

      potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration,
      zanidatamab targets and binds to the two distinct HER2 domains on the tumor
      cell surface. This results in dual HER2 signal blockade, HER2 clustering, receptor
      internalization and downregulation. This also induces a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
      (CTL) response and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against
      tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis
      (ADCP) is also induced and further stimulates the immune system to kill HER2-overexpressing
      tumor cells. The HER2 receptor internalization also further inhibits HER2 activation,
      HER2-mediated signaling and HER2-mediated tumor cell growth. HER2, a tyrosine
      kinase receptor, is overexpressed by many cancer cell types.

zorifertinib:
  common:
    description: >-
      An orally available inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
      with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration,  zorifertinib
      binds to and inhibits the activity of EGFR as well as certain mutant forms of
      EGFR. This prevents EGFR-mediated signaling, and may lead to both induction
      of cell death and inhibition of tumor growth in EGFR-overexpressing cells. EGFR,
      a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role
      in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.

zotatifin:
  common:
    description: >-
      A selective inhibitor of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A),
      with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of zotatifin, this
      agent targets and binds to elF4A, and promotes eIF4A binding to mRNA with specific
      polypurine motifs within their 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), leading to the
      formation of a stable sequence-specific ternary complex with eIF4A and mRNA
      (elF4A- zotatifin-mRNA). This results in the translational repression of key
      oncogenes and anti-apoptotic proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation,
      survival and metastasis, such as KRAS, Myc, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1),
      B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6, cyclin D,
      fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1 and 2, human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2; ERBB2), and beta-catenin. The inhibition of the expression
      of these oncogenes leads to the inhibition of various oncogenic signal transduction
      pathways. This inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in tumor cells.
      eIF4A, a RNA helicase and the rate-limiting component of the eukaryotic translation
      initiation complex, catalyzes the ATP-dependent unwinding of RNA duplexes and
      facilitates 43S ribosome scanning within the 5'-UTR. elF4A is activated by various
      oncogenic signaling pathways, including RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase
      (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways, and regulates
      the translation of oncogenes and tumor survival factors with complex secondary
      structures within the 5'-UTRs that are required for tumor cell proliferation,
      survival and metastasis.

zotiraciclib_citrate:
  common:
    description: >-
      An orally bioavailable citrate salt form of zotiraciclib a multi-kinase inhibitor
      for cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) subtypes 1, 2, 7 and 9, Janus-associated kinase
      2 (JAK2), FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3, FLK2, STK1), with potential antineoplastic
      activity. Upon oral administration, CDK/JAK2/FLT3 Inhibitor TG02 binds to and
      inhibits the CDK subtypes, JAK2, and FLT3. TG02 also inhibits, to a lesser extent,
      TYK2, TYRO3, STAT5 and P38delta. This may result in both an induction of apoptosis
      and an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in cancer cells that overexpress
      these kinases. JAK2, often upregulated or mutated in a variety of cancer cells,
      mediates STAT3 activation and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and
      survival. CDKs are serine/threonine kinases that play key roles in the regulation
      of the cell cycle and cellular proliferation. FLT3, a class III tyrosine kinase
      receptor, is overexpressed or mutated in most B lineage and acute myeloid leukemias.

aspirin:
  common:
    description: >-
      An orally administered non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent. Acetylsalicylic
      acid binds to and acetylates serine residues in cyclooxygenases, resulting in
      decreased synthesis of prostaglandin, platelet aggregation, and inflammation.
      This agent exhibits analgesic, antipyretic, and anticoagulant properties.

metformin:
  common:
    description: >-
      An agent belonging to the biguanide class of antidiabetics with antihyperglycemic
      activity. Metformin is associated with a very low incidence of lactic acidosis.
      This agent helps reduce LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and is not
      associated with weight gain, and prevents the cardiovascular complications of
      diabetes. Metformin is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.

acetaminophen:
  common:
    description: >-
      A p-aminophenol derivative with analgesic and antipyretic activities. Although
      the exact mechanism through which acetaminophen exert its effects has yet to
      be fully determined, acetaminophen may inhibit the nitric oxide (NO) pathway
      mediated by a variety of neurotransmitter receptors including N-methyl-D-aspartate
      (NMDA) and substance P, resulting in elevation of the pain threshold. The antipyretic
      activity may result from inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and release in
      the central nervous system (CNS) and prostaglandin-mediated effects on the heat-regulating
      center in the anterior hypothalamus.

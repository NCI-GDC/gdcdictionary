      nodular, ulcerative, superficial, multicentric, erythematous, and sclerosing
      or morphea-like. More than 95% of these carcinomas occur in patients over 40.
      They develop on hair-bearing skin, most commonly on sun-exposed areas. Approximately
      85% are found on the head and neck and the remaining 15% on the trunk and extremities.
      Basal cell carcinoma usually grows in a slow and indolent fashion. However,
      if untreated, the tumor may invade the subcutaneous fat, skeletal muscle and
      bone. Distant metastases are rare. Excision, curettage and irradiation cure
      most basal cell carcinomas.

    description: >-
      A malignant (clonal) hematologic disorder, involving hematopoietic stem cells

      chronic based on the degree of cellular differentiation and the predominant
      cell type present. Leukemia is usually associated with anemia, fever, hemorrhagic
      episodes, and splenomegaly. Common leukemias include acute myeloid leukemia,
      chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic or precursor lymphoblastic
      leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Treatment is vital to patient survival;
      untreated, the natural course of acute leukemias is normally measured in weeks
      or months, while that of chronic leukemias is more often measured in months
      or years.

      the overwhelming majority of prostatic carcinomas. Prostatic-specific antigen
      (PSA) serum test is widely used as a screening test for the early detection
      of prostatic carcinoma. Treatment options include radical prostatectomy, radiation
      therapy, androgen ablation and cryotherapy. Watchful waiting or surveillance

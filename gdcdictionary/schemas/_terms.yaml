basal_cell_cancer:

      The most frequently seen skin cancer. It arises from basal cells of the epidermis

      nodular, ulcerative, superficial, multicentric, erythematous, and sclerosing
      or morphea-like. More than 95% of these carcinomas occur in patients over 40.
      They develop on hair-bearing skin, most commonly on sun-exposed areas. Approximately
      85% are found on the head and neck and the remaining 15% on the trunk and extremities.
      Basal cell carcinoma usually grows in a slow and indolent fashion. However,
      if untreated, the tumor may invade the subcutaneous fat, skeletal muscle and
      bone. Distant metastases are rare. Excision, curettage and irradiation cure
      most basal cell carcinomas.

      A rare, highly aggressive and lethal carcinoma that affects children and young
      adults.  It arises from midline epithelial structures, most commonly the head,
      neck, and mediastinum.  It is a poorly differentiated carcinoma and is characterized
      by mutations and rearrangement of the NUT gene.  A balanced translocation t(15;19)
      is present that results in the creation of a fusion gene involving the NUT gene,
      most commonly BRD4-NUT fusion gene.

      white males in their 6-8th decades of life. Exposed and non-exposed skin sites
      are equally affected. UV damage and ingestion of inorganic arsenic may play
      a role in the development of the disease. On the skin surface, it presents as
      a single or multiple erythematous, scaly, keratotic patches or plaques. The
      clinical entity of erythroplasia of Queyrat is regarded as Bowen disease of
      the penis and it presents as an asymptomatic, red, circumscribed plaque. Morphologically,
      Bowen disease is characterized by the presence of hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis,
      dyskeratosis, and acanthosis. The keratotic squamous cells are atypical and
      display hyperchromatism and abnormal mitotic figures. The dermoepidermal basement
      membrane is intact. Complete surgical removal of the lesion may be curative.

      The most frequently seen skin cancer. It arises from basal cells of the epidermis
      and pilosebaceous units. Clinically it is divided into the following types:
      nodular, ulcerative, superficial, multicentric, erythematous, and sclerosing
      or morphea-like. More than 95% of these carcinomas occur in patients over 40.
      They develop on hair-bearing skin, most commonly on sun-exposed areas. Approximately
      85% are found on the head and neck and the remaining 15% on the trunk and extremities.
      Basal cell carcinoma usually grows in a slow and indolent fashion. However,
      if untreated, the tumor may invade the subcutaneous fat, skeletal muscle and
      bone. Distant metastases are rare. Excision, curettage and irradiation cure
      most basal cell carcinomas.

      A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is
      relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries
      south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over
      the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and
      even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females
      and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.
      Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present
      as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically,
      there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated
      to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize
      to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver
      cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular
      carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of
      tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

      An autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by the presence of multiple adenomas
      in the colon and rectum. It is caused by a germline mutation in the adenomatous
      polyposis coli (APC) gene which is located on the long arm of chromosome 5.
      The adenomas are most often tubular, and they have the tendency to progress
      to adenocarcinoma. They can occur throughout the colon, but they tend to concentrate
      in the rectum and sigmoid colon. The colorectal adenomas are detected during
      endoscopic examination between the age of 10 and 20 years. The adenomas increase
      in size and numbers with age, and there is usually progression of one or more
      adenomas to adenocarcinoma. The mean age of development of adenocarcinoma is
      about 40 years. Signs include rectal bleeding and mucousy diarrhea.

      cytoplasm which appears to displace the dark, angulated nucleus to the periphery
      of the cell. To make the diagnosis of gemistocytic astrocytoma, gemistocytes

      mediastinum. Histologic features include spindle cell proliferation (resembling
      a neurofibroma) and the presence of large ganglion cells. Common presenting
      features include a palpable abdominal mass, hepatomegaly, and a thoracic mass
      detected on routine chest X-ray.

adenoid_cystic_carcinoma:
  common:
    description: >-
      A malignant tumor arising from the epithelial cells.  Microscopically, the neoplastic
      epithelial cells form cylindrical spatial configurations (cribriform or classic
      type of adenoid cystic carcinoma), cordlike structures (tubular type of adenoid
      cystic carcinoma), or solid structures (basaloid variant of adenoid cystic carcinoma).  Adenoid
      cystic carcinomas mostly occur in the salivary glands.  Other primary sites
      of involvement include the lacrimal gland, the larynx, and the lungs.  Adenoid
      cystic carcinomas spread along nerve sheaths, resulting in severe pain, and
      they tend to recur.  Lymph node metastases are unusual; hematogenous tumor spread
      is characteristic.

      The adenomas are most often tubular, and they have the tendency to progress
      to adenocarcinoma. They can occur throughout the colon, but they tend to concentrate
      in the rectum and sigmoid colon. The colorectal adenomas are detected during
      endoscopic examination between the age of 10 and 20 years. The adenomas increase
      in size and numbers with age, and there is usually progression of one or more
      adenomas to adenocarcinoma. The mean age of development of adenocarcinoma is
      about 40 years. Signs include rectal bleeding and mucousy diarrhea.

      A granulosa cell tumor occurring in the ovary and rarely in the testis. It is
      composed of granulosa cells in an often fibrothecomatous stroma. The neoplastic
      cells may form various patterns including the microfollicular, which is characterized
      by the presence of Call-Exner bodies, macrofollicular, insular, trabecular,
      and diffuse pattern. In females, it affects middle aged to post-menopausal women.
      Signs and symptoms include abdominal mass, hemoperitoneum, and ascites. Estrogenic
      and rarely androgenic manifestations may be present. The vast majority of cases
      present as stage I tumors; however, all tumors have a potential for aggressive
      clinical course. In males, it is reported in the age range of 16-76 years and
      the average age at presentation is 44 years. A minority of patients have gynecomastia.
      Metastases have been reported in a minority of patients.

bowen_disease:
  common:
    description: >-
      A form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. It is a distinct clinicopathological
      entity and arises from the skin or the mucocutaneous junction. It affects predominantly
      white males in their 6-8th decades of life. Exposed and non-exposed skin sites
      are equally affected. UV damage and ingestion of inorganic arsenic may play
      a role in the development of the disease. On the skin surface, it presents as
      a single or multiple erythematous, scaly, keratotic patches or plaques. The
      clinical entity of erythroplasia of Queyrat is regarded as Bowen disease of
      the penis and it presents as an asymptomatic, red, circumscribed plaque. Morphologically,
      Bowen disease is characterized by the presence of hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis,
      dyskeratosis, and acanthosis. The keratotic squamous cells are atypical and
      display hyperchromatism and abnormal mitotic figures. The dermoepidermal basement
      membrane is intact. Complete surgical removal of the lesion may be curative.

      glandular epithelium are called adenocarcinomas, those that arise from squamous
      epithelium are called squamous cell carcinomas, and those that arise from transitional
      epithelium are called transitional cell carcinomas. Morphologically, the malignant
      epithelial cells may display abnormal mitotic figures, anaplasia, and necrosis.
      Carcinomas are graded by the degree of cellular differentiation as well, moderately,
      or poorly differentiated. Carcinomas invade the surrounding tissues and tend
      to metastasize to other anatomic sites. Lung carcinoma, skin carcinoma, breast
      carcinoma, colon carcinoma, and prostate carcinoma are the most frequently seen
      carcinomas.

      to adenocarcinoma. They can occur throughout the colon, but they tend to concentrate
      in the rectum and sigmoid colon. The colorectal adenomas are detected during
      endoscopic examination between the age of 10 and 20 years. The adenomas increase
      in size and numbers with age, and there is usually progression of one or more
      adenomas to adenocarcinoma. The mean age of development of adenocarcinoma is

      mutations. Until recently, surgery has been the only effective therapy for this
      tumor.  However, many patients still experience recurrence.  Conventional chemotherapy
      and radiation therapy have been of limited value.  A KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
      imatinib mesylate (also known as STI-571 or Gleevec), is now effective in the

      granulosa cells, with the latter constituting at least ten percent of the neoplasm.
      The vast majority of cases are stage I lesions at presentation and produce either
      estrogenic or androgenic manifestations. Although it may present as a massive
      ovarian tumor, it usually follows a benign clinical course. Very rare case reports
      of testicular lesions morphologically resembling gynandroblastomas are in fact
      variants of juvenile granulose cell tumor, or Sertoli cell tumor, or a combination

    description: >-
      A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is

      the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and
      even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females
      and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.
      Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present
      as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically,
      there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated
      to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize
      to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver
      cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular
      carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of

liver_cell_carcinoma:
  common:
    description: >-
      A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is
      relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries
      south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over
      the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and
      even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females
      and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.
      Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present
      as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically,
      there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated
      to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize
      to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver
      cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular
      carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of
      tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

      called neurofibromas.  They can develop anywhere along the peripheral nerve
      fibers. Neurofibromas can become quite large, causing a major disfigurement,
      eroding bone, and compressing various peripheral nerve structures.  Type 1 neurofibromatosis
      has dominant inheritance, with a gene locus on the proximal long arm of chromosome

      Approximately 95% of cases are diagnosed before age 5. These tumors may be multifocal,
      bilateral, congenital, inherited, or acquired. Seventy-five percent of retinoblastomas
      are unilateral; 60% occur sporadically. A predisposition to retinoblastoma has
      been associated with 13q14 cytogenetic abnormalities. Patients with the inherited
      form also appear to be at increased risk for secondary nonocular malignancies

      An aggressive, predominantly extranodal, mature T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
      It is characterized by an often angiocentric and angiodestructive cellular infiltrate
      composed of EBV positive NK/T cells. The nasal cavity is the most common site
      of involvement. Patients often present with midfacial destructive lesions (lethal
      midline granuloma). The disease may disseminate rapidly to various anatomic
      sites including the gastrointestinal tract, skin, testis, and cervical lymph
      nodes. It is also known as angiocentric T-cell lymphoma. The term "polymorphic
      reticulosis" has been widely used to describe the morphologic changes seen in
      this type of lymphoma. However, the latter term may also apply to lymphomatoid
      granulomatosis, which is an angiocentric and angiodestructive EBV positive B-cell
      lymphoproliferative disorder.

      potential of alkylating agents is believed to be age and cumulative dose-dependent.
      Deletions in chromosomes 5 and 7 are associated with susceptibility to this
      disorder. Clinical signs may include fatigue, dyspnea, bruising and frequent
      infections. Clinical course may progress to bone marrow failure or acute myeloid
      leukemia that is refractory to treatment. Prognosis is dismal with survivability
      usually less than one year.

      zone) which is rich in lymphocytes and an inner portion (medullary zone) which
      is rich in epithelial cells. It is an organ essential for the development of
      the immune system. Its function is the maturation of the progenitor lymphoid
      cells to thymocytes and subsequently to mature T-cells. It reaches its greatest

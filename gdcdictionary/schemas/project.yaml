        #   - submit -> submitted
        #   - release (project.released -> true)
        - review

        # submitted: An admin has submitted project, it is locked against
        #            upload.
        # possible actions in `submitted`:
        #   - process -> processing
        #   - release (project.released -> true)

        # processing: The system is processing data in the project and
        #             is locked against upload and submission
        #   - (system transition to open)
        #   - release (project.released -> true)
        - processing


        # closed: The closed state is introduced to replace the

        #         can be taken on the project

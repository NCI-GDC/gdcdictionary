  state:
    description: |
      The possible states a project can be in.  All but `open` are
      equivalent to some type of locked state.
    default: open
    enum:
        # open: the only state users can perform 'upload' actions
        # possible actions in `open`:
        #   - upload (no state change)
        #   - review -> review
        #   - release (project.released -> true)
        - open

        # locked: admin has locked project for review
        # possible actions in `locked`:
        #   - open -> open
        #   - submit -> submitted
        #   - release (project.released -> true)
        - review

        # submitted: An admin has submitted project, it is locked against
        #            upload.
        # possible actions in `submitted`:
        #   - process -> processing
        #   - release (project.released -> true)
        - submitted

        # processing: The system is processing data in the project and
        #             is locked against upload and submission
        #   - (system transition to open)
        #   - release (project.released -> true)
        - processing


        # closed: The closed state is introduced to replace the
        #         ``legacy`` state and means that no further action
        #         can be taken on the project
        #   - (system transition to open)
        #   - release (project.released -> true)
        - closed

        # DEPRECATED(2016-03-01): synonymous with closed. included for
        #                         backwards compatibility

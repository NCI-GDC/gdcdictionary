description: >
  Any material sample taken from a biological entity for testing, diagnostic, propagation, treatment
  or research purposes, including a sample obtained from a living organism or taken from the
  biological object after halting of all its life functions. Biospecimen can contain one or more
  components including but not limited to cellular molecules, cells, tissues, organs, body fluids,
  embryos, and body excretory products. In the case of contrived samples, it describes any material
  obtained from a normal donor.

  Any material sample taken from a biological entity for testing,
  diagnostic, propagation, treatment or research purposes, including a sample
  obtained from a living organism or taken from the biological object after
  halting of all its life functions. Biospecimen can contain one or more
  components including but not limited to cellular molecules, cells, tissues,
  organs, body fluids, embryos, and body excretory products.
